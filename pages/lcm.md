To the users of Zemaneh Yosef - זמני יוסף,

Network is net-worth, and the network of people working on Zemaneh Yosef has been helped tremendously from everyone in **Bet Midrash L’Talmud** (Lander College for Men), a Yeshiva that has not only been accepting of the Sepharadic tradition (as exemplified from Maran Rabbenu Ovadia Yosef zt”l), but encouraging of it too. Not only have we been enriched by the presence of a Sepharadic Hakham to lead the team, our knowledge of Halachic Times (Zemanim) has been expanded from supporting Ashkenazi Rabbanim such as _Rabbi Yitzhak Genack_ & _Rabbi Refael Shmuelvitz_. Furthermore, by guiding Talmidim through academic pursuits, we merited meeting _Adriel Kohananoo_ who designs our graphics, and even us developers met each-other through the Lander ecosystem. Suffice it to say, _Zemaneh Yosef_ would not be where it’s at without our home.

This Makom Torah needs to continue, to enrich us Talmidim in a wide spectrum of learning. We are running a fundraiser over the next **36 hours**, throughout March 25th & March 26th. Each contribution to this fundraiser will be matched four times, making every 100 USD donation worth 400 USD. It could only work if we meet our goal within the timespan.

Please [help us](https://www.charidy.com/doingMore/sephardi), in any way you can. For a Yeshiva that goes out of its way to provide Kosher food according to Sepharadic standards (Kemach Yashan, Bet Yosef) and has opportunities for us to practice our tradition (Learning Halacha through Night-Seder shiurim & minyanim with Birkat Kohanim), there is no time like the present to donate.

Thank you,<br>
~Maor Na’im & Elyahu Jacobi
