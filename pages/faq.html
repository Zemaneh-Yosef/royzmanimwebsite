        It all started in Israel in the year 1990. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef ZT"L saw
        that the sephardim were not following calendars that were properly
        adhering to the halachot and minhagim of their poskim. The people were
        using calendars (like Rabbi Tukachinsky's calendar) that followed
        Ashkenazic rulings with most of their times based entirely on degrees or
        other opinions.
        <br />
        Therefore, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef Z"TL started a project with the Ohr
        HaChaim yeshiva (which Rabbi Reuven Elbaz is the Rosh Yeshiva of), and
        together with Rabbi Shlomo Benizri and Rabbi Asher Darshan they sat down
        and created the "Luach HaMaor Ohr HaChaim" otherwise known as the Ohr
        HaChaim calendar.
        <br />
        Rabbi Shlomo Benizri was in charge of figuring out which halachot to ask
        Rabbi Ovadia about regarding the calendar, and Rabbi Asher Darshan was
        in charge of developing the physical calendar, and it's code.
        <br />
        After Rabbi Ovadia gave a
        <a

        to the calendar itself, the Ohr HaChaim calendar has been considered the
        most authoritative publication of zemanim according to Rabbi Ovadia
        Yosef, and its use is widespread in Israel.
        <br />
        Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef Shlita is known to give many haskamot, and he has
        even given haskamot to calendars that have not properly followed his
        halachot entirely. However, whenever
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfRwCklGz3c"
          >he mentions zemanim in his weekly shiurim</a
        >, he always mentions how the Ohr HaChaim calendar is the most accurate
        one. <br /><br />
        This website (and applications) can accurately recreate the Ohr HaChaim
        calendar, and it's underlying calculations for everywhere in Israel.

        While in Israel, if a person wants to follow Rabbi Ovadia's halachot,
        there is the Ohr HaChaim calendar to follow. Rabbi Ovadia never made a
        calendar for outside of Israel. There could be many reasons why he
        didn't want to create one, however, he obviously had an opinion on
        zemanim outside of Israel as we can see from Rabbi David Yosef's story
        (Halacha Berurah Chelek 14 Kuntrus Ki Ba Hashemesh Page 213) about Rabbi
        Ovadia spending Tisha Be'Av in New York and telling the congregation
        that they may end the fast at the Geonic Nightfall.
        <br /><br />
        This project was made for the following goals:
        <br />
        1.) To follow Rabbi Ovadia and his son's rulings inside of Israel AND
        outside of Israel.
        <br />
        2.) To give everyone access to the Ohr HaChaim calendar even if they
        didn't have the physical calendar.
        <br />
        3.) Having the Ohr HaChaim calendar's times on your phone was also a
        goal of this project
        <br />
        4.) To educate the people about sephardic zemanim.
        <br /><br />
        The layout and notifications of the applications were inspired by Jay
        Gindin's

        >. His application lets you choose from a list of opinions for various
        zemanim, however, not every zeman was included in his application and
        there was a lot of information that could have been added, like the
        weekly parasha.

        All of the zemanim, whether on the website or the applications, have
        explanations for how each zeman is calculated. Please refer to those
        dialogs to understand how a zeman is actually calculated.
        <br />
        However, when it comes to figuring out how to implement what the Ohr
        HaChaim calendar does in Israel. Thankfully, the Ohr HaChaim calendar
        explains how they calculate the zmanim in the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/Zemaneh-Yosef/RabbiOvadiahYosefCalendarAndroidApp/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction-to-the-calendar-in-israel"
          >introduction</a
        >
        of their calendar. With what they wrote in the introduction, most of the
        zemanim could be replicated. It is important to note that when they
        write "Astronomical" Sunrise/Sunset, they mean to include elevation in
        their calculations. While some others use the word astronomical to mean
        sea level sunrise. According to Rabbi Benizri and Rabbi Darshan, Rabbi
        Ovadia told them to calculate all the zemanim with elevation included
        and that is what we do by default in Israel. <br /><br />
        Now, when it comes to outside of Israel, we have been blessed with the
        opportunity to work with Rabbi Leeor Dahan and Rabbi Meir Gavriel Elbaz.
        Rabbi Dahan is the author of the Amudeh Horaah series on the Mishna
        Berurah. He has been kind enough to share with us his "Amudeh Horaah"
        calendar that also follows Rabbi Ovadia Yosef Z"TL but is designed for
        outside of Israel.
        <br />
        The Amudeh Horaah calendar is slightly different from the Ohr HaChaim
        calendar. Rabbi Dahan added in two zemanim into his calendar. Those
        being "Pelag Hamincha" according to the Halacha Berurah and "Tzet
        HaCochavim L'Chumra" (Stringent Nightfall). He also changed the zeman
        for "Tallit/Tefilin" to be 60 zemaniyot minutes and not 66 as the 66
        zeman was really only meant for people in great need.
        <br />
        In addition to those changes, the Amudeh Horaah calendar did not use
        elevation in it's zemanim calculations, and it adjusted any zeman that
        had to do with Alot Hashachar or Tzet HaCochavim (Dawn or Nightfall)
        according to the distance that the user is from the equator.
        <br /><br />
        To explain the last point, it is known that there are two differing
        opinions on how to calculate a shaah zemanit (seasonal hour):
        <br />
        1.) The GR"A and many others write to divide the day into 12 starting
        from sunrise and ending at sunset.
        <br />
        2.) The Terumat Hadeshen, Magen Avraham, and others write to split the
        day into 12 starting from Alot HaShachar to Tzeit HaCochavim (Dawn to
        Nightfall).
        <br /><br />
        Splitting the day into 12 hours according to the GR"A is simple, as
        anywhere you go you can figure out when sunrise/sunset is and you just
        need to split that into 12.
        <br />
        However, if you want to calculate a MG"A seasonal hour based on Alot to
        Tzet, many sephardic poskim say (See Minchat Kohen 2:4) that for outside
        of Israel there would need to be an adjustment based on the distance of
        the user from the equator because twilight is longer as you move away
        from the equator. The Halacha Berurah
        <a href="/assets/images/sources/HB261.jpg">(Siman 261:13)</a> writes
        this explicitly.
        <br />
        Although the Yalkut Yosef
        <a href="\assets\YalkutYosefSiman293.pdf"
          >(Siman 293 Page 716 top left paragraph)</a
        >
        seems to imply that the zemanim are the same everywhere in the world,
        and it even quotes the Yabia Omer as saying the same. The quoted Yabia
        Omer does not say that the zemanim do not need to be adjusted, rather it
        is talking about the 72 minutes of Rabbenu Tam being applicable to
        Israel as well. Seemingly, this Yalkut Yosef is incorrect as well,
        because our rabbanim have confirmed with Rav Yitzhak Yosef that there
        DOES need to be an adjustment to the zemanim outside of Israel.
        <br />
        Therefore, we do adjust the zemanim dealing with Alot HaShachar and Tzet
        HaCochavim according to the user's location outside of Israel.
        <br /><br />
        In order to figure out how to adjust the zemanim based on the equator,
        we use the degree that the sun is at in Israel and by setting the date
        of the calculations to the Equinox where a day is a perfect 12 hours
        (i.e. there are 60 minutes every hour), we can figure out how much to
        adjust.
        <br />
        For example:
        <br />
        If we want to figure out when is nightfall according to the geonim (13.5
        zemaniyot minutes), we would first go to Israel on the Equinox (around
        March 21st) and then find out what degree the sun is at when 13.5
        minutes have passed after sunset. In our testing, this has been around
        3.7 degrees. Then we can take that degree count and go back to New York.
        On March 21st in New York, how many regular minutes need to pass until
        the sun reaches 3.7 degrees. In our testing, this has been around 16-17
        minutes. Now that we know how much the zemanim have been adjusted, we
        can use that year round! So Nightfall of the geonim is at around 16-17
        seasonal minutes after sunset in New York year round!
        <br />
        This adjustment is used even in places closer to the equator where it
        would be even less time needed to get to nightfall of the geonim because
        it is more accurate to the nature there. However, it will "knowingly"
        not be as scientifically accurate as using straight degrees like the
        Ashkenazi poskim recommend. However, Sephardic poskim still recommend
        seasonal minutes because that is what the Gemara, Rishonim, and poskim
        have ruled to use.

        This is indeed one of the most difficult questions on the use of
        zemaniyot/seasonal minutes for zemanim.
        <br />
        This question is not specifically directed to our calendar, but rather,
        it is directed to the opinion of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef ZT"L, his sons, and
        all the Poskim that held to use seasonal minutes. Rabbi Ovadia was of
        the opinion that we live by the words of the Gemara, Rishonim, and
        Shulchan Aruch, and accordingly since a Mil is 18 minutes (Shulchan
        Aruch O.C. 459:2), the only possible times for Tzet Hacochavim/Nightfall
        is 3/4ths of a Mil (Geonim) or 4 Mil (R"T) (13.5/72 Seasonal or Regular
        minutes). Every other opinion was considered "new" and not a possibility
        as it did not have a source in the Gemara/Rishonim. For his Hashkafa
        (world view), the astronomical disconnect in the seasonal-hour position
        does not outweigh the fact that this was the traditional ruling of our
        authorities whom we've always consulted for other laws. If the Poskim
        said that Tzet Hacochavim is 13.5 minutes after sunset, then we take
        their words for it, and it does not matter whether we can see stars at
        that time period as we trust the Geonim over our lack of expertise. (See
        Halacha Berura 14, Kuntrus Ki Ba HaShemesh Ch. 17, Yabia Omer 7 Siman
        41, and Yalkut Yosef Siman 261).
        <br />
        Rabbi Dahan, who created the Amudeh Horaah calendar, also has a whole
        write-up (in response to another person's attacks on the Ohr HaChaim
        calendar) about why it is not an issue that you may find

        Rabbi Asher Darshan (who was on the team for the Ohr HaChaim calendar in
        Israel) reported that Rabbi Ovadia Yosef ZT"L held that the actual
        sunrise/sunset that should be used for calculating zmanim is when
        sunrise/sunset is seen at the highest point in the city. Rabbi Dahan
        says that this makes sense as Sephardim would follow sunset based on
        what they could see. However, Rabbi David Yosef Shlita writes that many
        have told him that Rabbi Ovadia ZT"L held to use Mishor (Sea Level)
        sunrise/sunset and others have told him in his father's name that
        elevation should be included for sunrise/sunset (i.e. the highest point
        in the city). Rabbi David writes that maybe Rabbi Ovadia only meant to
        use elevation based sunrise/sunset in cases where it would lead a person
        to be stringent. Rabbi Leeor Dahan says that it makes sense to use
        elevation in cities that are on hills and mountains, and to not use it
        when the city, E.G. New York, is close to sea level.
        <br /><br />
        (See Halacha Berura vol. 14, in Otzrot Yosef (Kuntrus Ki Ba Hashemesh),
        Siman 6, Perek 21 for an in depth discussion)
        <br /><br />
        We decided to enable elevation by default in Israel, as most users there
        are used to it being included in the calculations. However, for outside
        of Israel, even though we could get the user's elevation, we decided
        against using elevation as it is difficult to determine whether the user
        is on a hill or not just based on the user's elevation. For example,
        let's say a person is at the Grand Canyon. If he was standing at the top
        of the Grand Canyon, the elevation level would be over 2,100 meters!
        Whereas if he was located in the valley of the Grand Canyon, he would be
        only at an elevation level of 750 meters! This is all in a mile radius!
        Even though it is an extreme case, it illustrates the point that it is
        hard for an application to decide whether to use elevation.
        <br />
        In addition to this reason, many poskim (including Rabbi David Yosef)
        hold that zemanim should be calculated at sea level, so we can also rely
        on those poskim.
        <br />
        It should be noted that elevation's effect on zemanim gets significantly
        less impactful as the user gets higher and higher. The difference
        between 0 meters and 30 is whole minute, while the difference between
        10,000 meters and 11,000 meters is less than 10 seconds.
        <br />
        The ability to add elevation into the calculations of the zemanim are
        always available if the user desires it to be turned on.

      <p class="text-lg-start mt-1 p-3">
        This could be due to numerous reasons:
        <br />
        1.) The print based calendars are not exactly pointing to your
        individual location. They are just set to a general area or a point near
        you. While our applications use your exact latitude and longitude
        provided. In general, in order to get accurate zemanim for your
        location, you should provide your latitude and longitude. A Zip Code is
        good enough in many cases, however, there are
        <a
          href="https://kosherjava.com/2020/08/03/zip-codes-and-zmanim-a-practical-approach/"
          >exceptions</a
        >.
        <br />
        2.) The algorithm for sunrise and sunset is taken from the NOAA
        (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), whereas the Ohr
        HaChaim calendar (being closed sourced and choosing not to show the
        seconds for the times so we can not actually tell) might be using
        another algorithm for sunrise/sunset. (The Amudeh Horaah calendar uses
        NOAA)
        <br />
        3.) The algorithm for how much elevation should affect sunrise/sunset
        might be different as well.
        <br />
        4.) The user may be located near the bottom of the mountain and
        elevation might be lower than it should be.
        <br />
        5.) The calendars round up or round down the zemanim and they do not
        show the seconds. So it could be that we are rounding down while they
        are rounding up.
        <br /><br />
        In the end of the day, having a difference of a minute or two to the
        zemanim is not a huge problem as zemanim are not supposed too accurate
        to the second.

        First, see the dialog for the sunrise zeman by clicking on it in the
        website/applications. By default, we use Mishor (Sea Level) sunrise as
        it is easy to calculate. Ideally, you should download the VISIBLE
        sunrise times from the chaitables.com website as that is what the Yalkut
        Yosef holds is the most accurate sunrise (Yalkut Yosef 5764 edition
        Tefila Aleph Page 48, Sheirit Yosef 2 Page 253).

        See the dialog for the zeman for more information. But to put it simply:
        <br />
        There is a machloket as to when Pelag Ha'Minḥa is. Everyone says to use
        GR"A minutes to calculate it, however, the offset from sunset or tzet
        hacochavim is disputed. This causes a small 13.5 seasonal minute
        difference and even though the Ohr HaChaim calendar originally only
        showed the later time. The rabbanim have advised us that both zemanim
        are appropriate to rely on and to display both. However, if possible, it
        is preferable to delay arvit/accepting Shabbat until the later time has
        passed.

      <p class="text-lg-start mt-1 p-3">
        See the dialog for the zeman of Rabbenu Tam for more info. However,
        simply put, even though Rabbi Ovadia himself always kept the seasonal
        time of Rabbenu Tam. The Yalkut Yosef and Halacha Berurah both hold that
        in northern places in the world (like Europe and France), if Rabbenu Tam
        will take too long to pass, you need not be strict for the seasonal time
        of Rabbenu Tam. This is especially true if you adjust Rabbenu Tam based
        on the distance from the equator as Rabbenu Tam may go all the way until
        1 AM the next day.
        <br />
        Therefore, even though inside of Israel we always use the seasonal time
        of Rabbenu Tam. For outside of Israel, we limit it to 72 regular
        minutes.

        <div class="accordianText">
          <span
            >Why is there tachanun on Yom Yerushalayim and Yom Ha'atzmaut when
            Rabbi Ovadia writes to skip it?</span

      <p class="text-lg-start mt-1 p-3">
        First of all, it should be pointed out that we do not write to say
        tachanun on these days or not, we just inform the user that some people
        skip tachanun on these days and some do not.
        <br />
        Now to address the question itself:
        <br />
        Even though Rabbi Ovadia writes to skip tachanun on these days, it is
        not so simple to say that tachanun should always be skipped on those
        days everywhere.
        <br />
        As Rabbi Dahan explains: "Israel is intensely charged. People take it
        extremely personal because it is to so many". It would be difficult to
        tell these people that nothing special happened on these days and that
        tachanun should be said like a regular day.
        <br />
        Although, Rabbi Yonatan Nacson writes that we can rely on Rabbi Ovadia's
        writings to not say tachanun on these days, other rabbanim are not so
        accepting of that fact because Israel was "intensely charged".
        <br />
        Rabbi Meir Gavriel Elbaz says that the custom of the Yeshiva/Kollel
        "Chazon Ovadia" was to follow what Rabbi Ovadia did in his personal shul
        and skip tachanun only on Yom Yerushalayim (not for mincha the day
        before).
        <br /><br />
        Inside the website and applications, we simply write, "Some say
        tachanun" or "Some skip tachanun by mincha" to avoid the debate entirely
        as this is not something an application can decide for you.
