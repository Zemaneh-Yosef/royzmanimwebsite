    to the GR"A. However, a person can still say Pisukei DeZimra until
    Hatzot.

    The GR"A calculates this time as 4 zemaniyot/seasonal hours after

    This is the middle of the halachic day, when the sun is exactly in
    the middle of the sky relative to the length of the day. It should
    be noted, that the sun can only be directly above every person, such
    that they don't even have shadows, in the Tropic of Cancer and the
    Tropic of Capricorn. Everywhere else, the sun will be at an angle
    even in the middle of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
    After this time, you can no longer say the Amidah prayer of
    Shacharit, and you should preferably say Musaf before this time.
    </p>

    This time is calculated as 6 zmaniyot/seasonal hours after sunrise.

    This is the ideal time for a person to light the candles before

    When there is candle lighting on a day that is Yom tov/Shabbat
    before another day that is Yom tov, the candles are lit after
    Tzet/Nightfall. However, if the next day is Shabbat, the candles
    are lit at their usual time.

    This is the time of the day that the day starts to transition into
    the next day according to halacha.
    </p>
    <p>
    Halachic sunset is defined as the moment when the top edge of the
    sun disappears on the horizon while setting (elevation included).
    Whereas, the gentiles define sunset as the moment when the sun is
    halfway through the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
    Immediately after the sun sets, Ben Hashmashot/twilight starts
    according to the Geonim, however, according to Rabbeinu Tam the sun
    continues to set for another 58.5 minutes and only after that Bein
    Hashmashot starts for another 13.5 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
    It should be noted that many poskim, like the Mishna Berura, say
    that a person should ideally say mincha BEFORE sunset and not before
    Tzet/Nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
    Most mitzvot that are to be done during the day should ideally be
    done before this time.

    Tzet/Nightfall is the time when the next halachic day starts after
    Bein Hashmashot/twilight finishes.

    <p>
    This is the latest time a person can start praying Minḥa according to Rav
    Ovadia Yosef Z"TL. Although he previously ruled one should only do so if he could
    pray the majority of the Tefila before this time (matching the BI"Ḥ - Vayakhel IX),
    he uses the sefer "Bateh Knessiot" (siman 89) to permit one to start even if
    the above condition won't be met (Yabia Omer VII Siman 34).
    </p>
    <p>
    This time is calculated as 13 and a half zmaniyot/seasonal minutes
    after sunset (elevation included). For stringent matters (brit milot, end of fasts),
    we use 20 zemaniyot/seasonal minutes after sunset. The GR\"A calculates a zemaniyot/seasonal
    hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation included) and divides it into
    12 equal parts. Then we divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get
    a zemaniyot/seasonal minute.
    </p>
    <p>
    Outside Eretz Yisrael, these numbers ("13.5" & "20") are measured in the form of degrees
    below the horizon (thus being converted to 3.86 & 5.3 degrees respectively) to be then
    applied on the equinox day, thus giving us a new number to make seasonal that reflects
    the local astronomy.

    Tzet/Nightfall is the time when the next halachic day starts after
    Ben Hashmashot/twilight finishes. Although we normally determine that
    by waiting 13.5 minutes, there is a recommended (yet optional) stringency
    by following Rabbenu Tam's opinion, through waiting the same amount
    of time between Dawn until sunrise
    </p>
    <p>
    This time is calculated as 72 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes after sunset
    (elevation included). According to Rabbeinu Tam, these 72 minutes
    are made up of 2 parts. The first part is 58 and a half minutes
    until the second sunset (see Pesachim 94a and Tosafot there). After
    the second sunset, there are an additional 13.5 minutes until
    Tzet/Nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
    Getting the resulting time for the letter-of-the law reading
    is as easy as following the assertion; if Rabbenu Tam is supposed to
    match the time from Dawn until sunrise (only difference being one would offset
    from sunset), one would just measure those minutes and add onto the time of sunset.
    Nevertheless, there are leniencies in play that one would want to factor for;
    specifically, the Yalkut Yosef introduces the opportunity to use RT's Ben Hashemashot
    to permit melakha after Shabbat for those wanting to be stringent
    by his nightfall yet unable to complete it. Similarly, outside Eretz Yisrael,
    one may be lenient to calculate RT's opinion using fixed minutes when the seasonal minutes
    surpass them. Although this is against Rav Ovadia Yosef's personal ruling,
    we rely on his son's who spelt out rulings for outside Eretz Yisrael.
