Although the Passover holiday only begins on the 15<sup>th</sup> of Nisan for the following seven days, the Talmud (Pesaḥim Bavli 5a) includes a Biblical prohibition of חמץ during the 14<sup>th</sup>, due to an apparant contradiction between the commandment to dispose of the חמץ on the same day that one should not own any to dispose of. This reading is supported by the verse's (Parashat Bo, Exodus 12:15) use of the word הראשון as opposed to the simpler ראשון. With the preceeding words including "אך", we learn that this day is divided into two halves, with the first half focused on the action of תשביתו.

The second half (בן הערבים - starts after the end of the 6<sup>th</sup> hour/beginning of the 7<sup>th</sup>) is the timeframe of the Biblical prohibition, mimicking the days when the Temple stood and one would bring the relevant Korban offering (translated to time in our days when we're unable to bring any offerings - "זְמַן שְׁחִיטָה אָמַר רַחֲמָנָא" [Pesaḥim Bavli 5b]). Once the offering is brought, it is forbidden to own or derive benefit (including eating) from חמץ, as said in Exodus 34:25 - "לֹֽא־תִשְׁחַ֥ט עַל־חָמֵ֖ץ דַּם־זִבְחִ֑י". In specific, violating this prohibition transgresses a negative commandment, which is learned out from the *Asmakhta* of "וְזָבַ֥חְתָּ פֶּ֛סַח לַיהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ...לֹא־תֹאכַ֤ל עָלָיו֙ חָמֵ֔ץ" (Deuteronomy 16:2-3. Ruling came from Rabbi Yehuda, Pesaḥim Bavli 28b; later codified in two foremost authorities [רמב"ם הלכות חמץ ומצה א':ח'; רא"ש פסחים סוף ב':ד' - "וכן נראה לי"] and other Rishonim [רב יצחק אבן גיאת ז"ל בשם הרא"ש ומגיד משנה]).

Due to concerns about potentially mistaking this time on a cloudy day, the rabbinic safeguard introduced a new minimum of the entire 6<sup>th</sup> hour, forbidding all activity related to חמץ for an additional hour (starting at the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> hour). Additionally, Rabbi Yehuda further restricted _eating_ חמץ throughout the 5<sup>th</sup> hour (which starts at the beginning of the 4<sup></sup>), adding a second hour on top of the original rabbinic safeguard (Mishna Pesaḥim 1:4; Pesaḥim Bavli 12b; Rambam Hilchot Hametz Umatzah 1:9).

These hours are calculated by dividing the length of the day into into 12 timeframes, each portion representing a "seasonal hour". Although the typical length of the day is measured from sunrise until sunset, the severity of חמץ demands us to be strict (unless it's for permiting a child to eat חמץ, meaning they would be lenient to stop by the time we would normally report as "Sof Zeman Berakhot Shema"; see Ḥazon Ovadia - Pesach I pg. 60 & Yalkut Yosef on Pesach (5775 edition) pg. 652) to extend the day symmetrically to *Dawn* & *Nightfall* (Pri Ḥadash, beginning of Siman 443 & Ḥazon Ovadia II pg. 37. The Nightfall chosen is Rabbenu Tam's, as it includes the 58.5 minutes needed for the expected symmetry), similar to the rules of "Sof Zeman Keriat Shema".
