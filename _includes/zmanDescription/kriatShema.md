<!-- The Torah obligation to read Keriat Shema (קריאת שמע) during the daytime (bounding the commandment to the time, as ruled by בית הלל) is derived is bound to the time people would arise, derived from the word ובקומך used in the relevant paragraphs (interpreted as time by בית הלל; irrespective of the action, which is the opinion of בית שמאי). The extent of this time is the third halachic hour, which is when people of luxury would arise in the morning. -->

This time is the third halachic hour of the day, by when people of luxury would arise in the morning. The תנאים (Tanaic Sages) codified this time to have one completely read קריאת שמע (Kriat Shema) before then (R' Yehoshua in Mishnah Berakhoth 1:2, Shemuel in Talmud Bavli 10b), based on the word ובקומך (as one rises).

To calculate this time, one would need to know how long a seasonal hour is and when to start counting from (the time you start measuring the length of a seasonal hour will also determine when the seasonal hour starts). A majority of Poskim understand the day's seasonal hour length to be determined by dividing the length of time between *sunrise* and *sunset* into 12 timeframes (called "seasonal hours"), of which include the Rambam (Kriat Shema 1:11), Rav Sa'adia Gaon (Siddur, page 12) and the Vilna Gaon (reflected in Biur HaGra on Oraḥ Ḥayim, 459:2).

However, some are stringent to measure the day's seasonal hour length by dividing the length of time from *Alot Hashachar* until *Tzet Ha'Kokhavim* into 12 timeframes (called "seasonal hours"), of which include the Ḥida (Shu"t Ḥayim Sha-al II 38:70), Ben Ish Ḥai (Rav Pa'alim 2:2 & BI"Ḥ Vayakhel 4), Kaf Hachaim (58:4) & Terumat Hadeshen. To calculate as such in a symmetric fashion (so that the midpoint of both sunrise->sunset + alot->tzet line up), one would need to measure Tzet Ha'Kokhavim by Rabbenu Tam's time; otherwise, there is a missing 58.5 minutes between the time of the Geonic Tzet Ha'Kokhavim and Rabbenu Tam's (counterpoint would be the Ben Ish Ḥai's calculations, which are indeed shifted by that time).
- As per the rule of Halichot Olam (v. 1 Vaera 3), one should be stringent by this opinion since this is a matter of a Biblical commandment, especially when the Maghen Avraham (58:1) interprets even the earlier Poskim quoted above to hold by this time when it comes to Shema. However, one who did not manage to fulfil this stringency in time should still aim to say Kriat Shema by the time of the "Vilna Gaon".

Within the seasonal hour, there are two time periods; the beginning of the hour or the end of the hour. Although the Geonic era of Poskim hold by the beginning of the third hour (Machzor Vitri I pg 7; Siddur Rav Amram 1:15-16), the Shulḥan Arukh (Oraḥ Ḥayim, 58:6) held like the Rambam (_ibid_) as well as other Rishonim (Chinuch 420; Tosafoth Avodah Zara 4b s.v. Betelat) who instead calculate it by the _end_ of the third hour.
