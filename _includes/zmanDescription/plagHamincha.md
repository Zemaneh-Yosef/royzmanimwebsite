The time from מנחה קטנה until the end of the day is divided into two halves, each lasting 1¼ seasonal hours (Berakhoth Bavli 27a, since מנחה קטנה itself lasts 2½ seasonal hours). By the second half (which we call פלג המנחה), one can start performing a select few commandments of the night, such as accepting Shabbat early (S"A O"Ḥ, 273:4), lighting Ḥanukah candles early (footnotes of Ḥazon Ovadia Ḥanukah pg. 89) or praying תפילת ערבית when one (preferably) already prayed Minḥa (Berakhoth 26a, Rabbi Yehuda).

The Mishna (in Berakhoth 4:1) introduces the time of פלג המנחה through the contrast of "ערב", which is by definition the endpoint of the day. Since Halachic times use the day's length measured from sunrise until sunset (Halikhot Olam, vol. 1 pg. 248), it would be consistent to say that the end of the seasonal hour measurement is also the end of the day. Thereby, פלג המנחה would be 1¼ seasonal hours before _sunset_ (as held by Talmideh Rabbenu Yonah (Berakhoth Bavli 26a), Rambam in Hilkhot Tefila 3:4, Kaf Hachaim on O"Ḥ 233:7, Shilteh Hagiborim on the Mordekhi & R' Yitzḥak Yisraeli's explanation of the Meiri - Yoseh Binah pg. 105). Rabbenu Ḥananel implicitly supports this by quoting R' Yehuda's parallel between the rules of the שתי תמידים and when one can pray תפילות שחרית ומנחה; since the כבש בבוקר (which corresponds to תפילת שחרית) can only be brought from sunrise and the כבש של בין הארבים (which corresponds to תפילת המנחה) can only be brought until sunset, these hours must be measured from sunrise until sunset.

However, a majority of the authorities define ערב as nightfall. Although most assume consistency and therefore adjust everything to be proportionate (such as measuring the day's length from Dawn until Rabbenu Tam's Nightfall since that's a nightfall that is proportionate to Dawn), Pelag Hamincha is **independent** of proportionality (Pri Ḥadash, Kuntress Debei Shimsha, end of ספר מים חיים) and as such, there are opinions that'll use different rulings no matter how inconsistent they are under traditional means. One of these authorities is the Ben Ish Ḥai (1<sup>st</sup> year Vayakhel VIII; see also Terumath Hadeshen siman 1 & Ohr Letzion vol. 2 pg. 147), who ruled to use both the _Geonic Nightfall_ and the seasonal time measured from sunrise to sunset (Igur, end of Siman 327). Therefore, there is a difference of 13½ seasonal minutes between the two.

For R' Ovadia & co.'s rulings, one could assume *all* would agree to the Rambam's time had there been no concern of blessings (from ערבית or candle lighting) being recited in vain. However, since every command attachable to פלג המנחה has a blessing to accompany, there is a disagreement whether one can use this earlier time:

- R' Avraham Yosef ([Parashat Terumah 5779 shiur min 3:55](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/76371)) & R' Yitzḥak Yosef ([Motzei Shabbat Pesach 5779 shiur min 37](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/81670), [Motzei Shabbat Bo 5778 shiur min 25](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/55391), Yalkut Yosef new edition, siman 271, pages 139 & 144-147) quote their father (Yabia Omer vol. 2 siman 21 num. 15) to use the later time from the BI"Ḥ, concerning themselves with a potential of blessings (of ערבית and הדלקת נרות) being said in vain.
- R' David Yosef (in אוצרות יוסף תשובה ז בסוף הלכה ברורה חלק י"ד) uses the status of our custom/מנהג (to calculate the times from sunrise to sunset) as a means to negate the concern of reciting blessings in vain (as was also said by the Minḥat Kohen - Ma-amar II, end of 9<sup>th</sup> chapter. This is also applicable for סוף זמן תפילה, where we are not concerned for the MG"A seasonal hour calculation). Furthermore, even if our Geonim (of whom we established our custom on) used their nightfall, there would be a mismatch between חצות and astronomical midday (issue quoted by Shu"t Divreh Yosef Shwartz pg. 58 & R' Tukachinsky in the Sefer "Ben Hashmashot", pg. 98).
- In R' Ovadia's later writings, in the section on how to calculate שעות היום (located in the Halikhot Olam above, in the same Parasha that discusses Minḥa times), there was no distinction made between Pelag Haminḥa and other times. Based on the lack of explicit exception, one can assume he changed his time from the Yabia Omer quote (ibid) and adopted the position maintained by the Halacha Berurah for all Rabbinic matters.

One could not use out-of-context lines from R' David (like in Halacha Berurah Siman 233 pg. 75) or R' Ovadia (Hazon Ovadia Ta-anit pg. 94, Halikhot Olam vol. 1 pg. 223) that tell the later time, since those sections are really talking about a way to be exempt according to both sides, without indication of which side one actually holds like. Furthermore, everyone would agree in cases of actual Biblically-binding commandments to use the Yalkut Yosef time (such as by קידוש של ליל שבת or הבדלה מוקדם ביום שבת), although the time in between the two gets quickly filled up by other commandments that would need to come before it (like ערבית).

Fun Fact: Authorities that hold by *Rabbenu Tam's Nightfall* typically calculate seasonal time from dawn until nightfall, since they are of equal length. However, maintaining the seasonal time from sunrise to sunset (as does the Ra'ah, Berakhoth 26b; Ritva, Berakhoth 27b; Ramban, Pesaḥim 54b - How short the walk between the two is, 33.3/2-000 vs 40/2000) while still defining the time of ערב as nightfall creates a time for פלג המנחה that only has **three minutes** of a time difference between the two. This introduces many difficulties (such as the inability to light שבת candles until then, as said by Rabbi Yaakov Emden, Prozdor Bayit 41, paragraph 28), making it impossible to follow this shita without major risk of שבת desecration according to those authorities (who we do not hold like).
