The time from מנחה קטנה until the end of the day is divided into two halves, each lasting 1¼ seasonal hours (Berakhoth Bavli 27a, since מנחה קטנה itself lasts 2½ seasonal hours). The second half is called פלג המנחה - it is during this time that one may start performing a select few commandments of the night, such as accepting Shabbat early (Shulḥan Arukh O"Ḥ, 273:4), lighting Ḥanukah candles early (footnotes of Ḥazon Ovadia Ḥanukah pg. 89) or praying תפילת ערבית when one (preferably) already prayed Minḥa (Berakhoth 26a, Rabbi Yehuda).

When discussing the latest time one can pray מנחה, the Mishna (Berakhoth 4:1) introduces פלג המנחה as being an offset of ערב - the endpoint of the day. Thus, there is a connection between the last time to pray מנחה and the end of the Halachic day. In theory, this would mean one could not pray מנחה after these 1¼ seasonal minutes, the seasonal minutes being measured using this length and this time also being the end of the day. These are two details crucial to the consistency of seasonal hours and the limit of the day. Indeed, we find past authorities (mostly) being consistent with their own rulings:

- The Geonim who held of the seasonal hours between sunrise to sunset (using both endpoints as the measurement of the day's length) maintained that פלג המנחה would happen 1¼ seasonal hours before _sunset_ (as held by Talmideh Rabbenu Yonah (Berakhoth Bavli 26a); Rambam, Laws of Prayer, 3:4; Kaf Ha'Ḥayyim on O"Ḥ 233:7; Shilteh Hagiborim on the Mordekhi; R' Yitzḥak Yisraeli's explanation of the Meiri - Yoseh Binah pg. 105). Rabbenu Ḥananel implicitly supports this by quoting R' Yehuda's parallel between the rules of the שתי תמידים and when one can pray תפילות שחרית ומנחה; since the כבש בבוקר (which corresponds to תפילת שחרית) can only be brought from sunrise and the כבש של בין הארבים (which corresponds to תפילת המנחה) can only be brought until sunset, these hours must be measured from sunrise until sunset.
- The other authorities who held of the seasonal minutes between Dawn and its proportionate Nightfall (of 72 minutes) permitted מנחה to be said during בן השמשות, thus defining ערב as Nightfall. As such, these 1¼ extended-seasonal hours will be offset from Nightfall instead. This is the position of the Shulḥan Arukh (O"Ḥ 233)

In practice, these ideals are not always respected. Not only are the seasonal minutes independent of the proportionality of the day (Pri Ḥadash, Kuntress Debei Shimsha, end of ספר מים חיים), but we also separate the attribution of מנחה's endtime to the end of the day, thus permitting us to pray מנחה until the Geonic Nightfall. As such, the Ben Ish Ḥai (1<sup>st</sup> year Vayakhel VIII; see also Terumath Hadeshen siman 1 & Ohr Letzion vol. 2 pg. 147) ruled to use his disproportionate seasonal length to determine the time for פלג.

This is all a build up to the opinions of Yabi'a Omer (vol. 2 siman 21 num. 15) and his two sons - R' Avraham Yosef in his [Parashat Terumah 5779 shiur min 3:55](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/76371) as well as R Yitzḥak Yosef in multiple shiurim ([Motzei Shabbat Pesach 5779 shiur min 37](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/81670), [Motzei Shabbat Bo 5778 shiur min 25](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/55391)) & his Yalkut Yosef (new edition, siman 271, pages 139 & 144-147) - based on this BI"Ḥ to use the regular seasonal minutes (Igur, end of Siman 327) with the endpoint as the Geonic Nightfall. This ruling is applied not only in its stringencies (such as by blessings in vain, when coming to ערבית and הדלקת נרות), but also in its leniencies (such as the last time to eat [Seudat Shelishit] on Erev Pesaḥ - see Ḥ"'O Pesaḥ pg. 67 & pg. 199). This is also reflected in later writings of Maran zt'l himself (Ḥazon 'Ovadia Ta'anit pg. 94; Halikhot 'Olam vol. 1 pg. 223), even if he's not made mention of it by earlier sections of how seasonal hours work (Halikhot Olam, vol. 1 pg. 248). The use of regular seasonal minutes despite being an offset to Nightfall (which isn't in the sunrise-to-sunset range) is open to questioning.

On the other end of the Yosef dynasty, R' David Yosef (אוצרות יוסף תשובה ז בסוף הלכה ברורה חלק י"ד) reasserts the original practice of Sepharadic Jews to restore the definition of פלג to the practice of the Geonim, thus keeping the 1¼ seasonal hour length but as an offset from sunset. Responding to the concern that there would be potentially questionable blessings, we do not rule such when the custom is otherwise (as ruled by the Minḥat Kohen - Ma-amar II, end of 9<sup>th</sup> chapter. This is also applicable for סוף זמן תפילה, where we are not concerned for the MG"A seasonal hour calculation). To counterclaim the opinion of the Yalkut Yosef & Yabi'a Omer, there is no precedent to use the Geonic Nightfall for פלג המנחה purposes, since even those that used Nightfall for פלג only did so previously with their seasonal minutes that went to its proportionate Nightfall - using the Geonic Nightfall as a basis for seasonal minutes would make the minutes disproportionate, since it's only being extended by 13.5 seasonal minutes in one pulled direction and now halachic midday would not match its astronomical description (see Shu"t Divreh Yosef Shwartz pg. 58 & R' Tukachinsky in the Sefer "Ben Hashmashot", pg. 98). The only inconsistency with this opinion is that the Halacha Berura still permits מנחה to be prayed after sunset - normally, one cannot pray מנחה after the 1¼ seasonal hours of פלג המנחה.

Fun Fact: Authorities that hold by *Rabbenu Tam's Nightfall* typically calculate seasonal time from dawn until nightfall, since they are of equal length. However, maintaining the seasonal time from sunrise to sunset (as does the Ra'ah, Berakhoth 26b; Ritva, Berakhoth 27b; Ramban, Pesaḥim 54b - How short the walk between the two is, 33.3/2-000 vs 40/2000) while still defining the time of ערב as nightfall creates a time for פלג המנחה that only has **three minutes** of a time difference between the two. This introduces many difficulties (such as the inability to light שבת candles until then, as said by Rabbi Yaakov Emden, Prozdor Bayit 41, paragraph 28), making it impossible to follow this shita without major risk of שבת desecration according to those authorities (who we do not hold like).
