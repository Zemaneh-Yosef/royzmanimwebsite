Pelag Ha'Minḥa is the second half of the time between מנחה קטנה until the end of the day (ערב), marked at 10¾ hours into the day (Berakhot Bavli 26b - "11 minus a quarter hours"). Since מנחה קטנה happens only 9½ into the day, this gives only 1¼ seasonal hours from the start of this half until the end of the מנחה. It is during this time that one may start performing a select few commandments of the night, such as accepting Shabbat early (Shulḥan Arukh O"Ḥ, 273:4), lighting Ḥanukah candles early (footnotes of Ḥazon Ovadia Ḥanukah pg. 89) or praying תפילת ערבית when one (preferably) already prayed Minḥa (Berakhoth 26a, Rabbi Yehuda).

The context of the Gemara only discussed this time in relevance to מנחה, with its endtime of ערב (also known as the last time to pray מנחה). Thus, considering the description indicates a half of מנחה קטנה with its times pegged in the range of the day (that being the day lasting 12 hours long and this being 10.75/12), it indicates a consistency with the seasonal minutes being used. The question remains, though: What are those seasonal minutes?

- The seasonal hours from sunrise to sunset is the one that directly corresponds to the Korban-equivalent of our prayers (which in the case of מנחה would be the כבש של בין הערבים), as per the proof of Rabbenu Ḥananel (citing R' Yehuda's parallel's between the rules of the שתי תמידים and when one can pray the two daytime prayers). Thus, this times פלג המנחה at 1¼ seasonal hours before sunset (as held by Talmideh Rabbenu Yonah (Berakhoth Bavli 26a); Rambam, Laws of Prayer, 3:4; Kaf Ha'Ḥayyim on O"Ḥ 233:7; Shilteh Hagiborim on the Mordekhi; R' Yitzḥak Yisraeli's explanation of the Meiri - Yoseh Binah pg. 105).
- However, the definition of a day is explicitly defined otherwise (Pesaḥim Bavli 94a), as starting by Dawn and ending by Nightfall, thus leaving מנחה prayable until Nightfall. Ideally, they would also use the definition of Nightfall there (72 minutes - what's popularly known as Rabbenu Tam's Nightfall, proportionate to Dawn's 72 minutes to start the day) to make halachic midday consistent with the sun's midpoint in its traversal (an issue raised by Shu"t Divreh Yosef Shwartz pg. 58 & R' Tukachinsky in the Sefer "Ben Hashmashot", pg. 98), as well as use its seasonal minutes (thus is the practice of the Terumat Ha'Deshen; see siman I). Nevertheless, Pelag Ha'Minḥa is independent from proportionality (as discussed in Pri Ḥadash, Kuntress Debei Shimsha, end of ספר מים חיים), hence allowing either one of those rules to be broken. This opened the door for two preceeding interpretations: The S"A & Ramban (in addition to Ra'ah, Berakhoth 26b; Ritva, Berakhoth 27b; Rabbi Yaakov Emden, Prozdor Bayit 41, paragraph 28 explicitly links this for Shabbat candle lighting) who used the sunrise-to-sunset seasonal hours offset from that later Nightfall (see the Ramban, Pesaḥim 54b; as for the S"A, see O"Ḥ 233 for Nightfall being the endtime of מנחה, but for Pelag in specific, see O"Ḥ 261, saying that תוספת שבת - a time that is done from Pelag - being described as a sunset offset. The commentaries there discuss the nuance is because they're so short it's easier to describe the astronomical sight one can see). Contemporary authorities, however, switched the rule to instead remain consistent with the seasonal hour but inconsistent with the 4 mil description of צאת הכוכבים (see the Ben Ish Ḥai, Year I, Vayakhel VIII; see also Ohr Letzion vol. 2 pg. 147 & the responsas of the Ma'amar Mordechai vol. 4 siman 12)

This is all a build up to the opinions of Yabi'a Omer (vol. 2 siman 21 num. 15) and his two sons - R' Avraham Yosef in his [Parashat Terumah 5779 shiur min 3:55](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/76371) as well as R Yitzḥak Yosef in multiple shiurim ([Motzei Shabbat Pesach 5779 shiur min 37](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/81670), [Motzei Shabbat Bo 5778 shiur min 25](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/55391)) & his Yalkut Yosef (new edition, siman 271, pages 139 & 144-147) - to use the Geonic Nightfall as an offset for Pelag, in both stringencies (such as by blessings in vain, when coming to ערבית and הדלקת נרות), but _also in its leniencies_ (such as the last time to eat [Seudat Shelishit] on Erev Pesaḥ - see Ḥ"'O Pesaḥ pg. 67 & pg. 199). This is also reflected in later writings of Maran zt'l himself (Ḥazon 'Ovadia Ta'anit pg. 94; Halikhot 'Olam vol. 1 pg. 223), even if he's not made mention of it by earlier sections of how seasonal hours work (Halikhot Olam, vol. 1 pg. 248). However, although there is precedent to ignore _either_ proportionality of the day for Nightfall _or_ the day's standard seasonal minutes from sunrise to sunset, this position araises questions because it does _both_ as well as not affecting any other זמן, such as listing a "מנחה קטנה י"י".

On the other end of the Yosef dynasty, R' David Yosef (אוצרות יוסף תשובה ז בסוף הלכה ברורה חלק י"ד) reasserts the original practice of Sepharadic Jews to restore the definition of פלג as an 1¼ seasonal hour offset from sunset, as a response to the questions araised from the Yabi'a Omer position. Responding to the concern that there would be potentially questionable blessings, we do not rule such when the custom is otherwise (as ruled by the Minḥat Kohen - Ma-amar II, end of 9<sup>th</sup> chapter. This is also applicable for סוף זמן תפילה, where we are not concerned for the MG"A seasonal hour calculation). However, the Halacha Berura also allows praying מנחה after sunset; although this would be fine if it was reserved as a בדיעבד ruling, the Halacha Berura relies on this time enough that one should prefer this time for minyan, even though he wouldn't use it as a reliability for the calculation of פלג המנחה.

Fun fact: Under Biblical Hebrew rules of "קטל", the proper pronounciation of פלג המנחה should transliterate to "Peleg Ha'Minḥa". Nevertheless, we've kept it "Pelag" to adhear to Hakham Ovadia's pronounciation style.
