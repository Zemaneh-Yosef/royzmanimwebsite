Pelag Ha'Minḥa is the second half of the time between מנחה קטנה until the end of the day (ערב), marked at 10¾ hours into the day (Berakhot Bavli 26b). Since מנחה קטנה happens only 9½ into the day, this gives only 1¼ seasonal hours from the start of this half until the end of the מנחה. It is during this time that one may start performing a select few commandments of the night, such as accepting Shabbat early (Shulḥan Arukh O"Ḥ, 273:4), lighting Ḥanukah candles early (footnotes of Ḥazon Ovadia Ḥanukah pg. 89) or praying תפילת ערבית when one (preferably) already prayed Minḥa (Berakhoth 26a, Rabbi Yehuda).

The Gemara's only question in deciding the time is whether it's half of מנחה גדולה or מנחה קטנה; once the _beraita_ clarified that it's the latter, it then plots the day's range using the assumption that the day is 12 hours. To do that, it describes that מנחה קטנה is the 9½'th hour of the day, then says explicitly that a) פלג המנחה starts at "11 minus a quarter hours" and b) half of מנחה קטנה. From there, we could assume that these two halves are equal and thus, ערב would be at that 12<sup>th</sup> hour, after **both** halves of מנחה קטנה passed. However, the גמרה never defined ערב explicitly, thus leaving it to the ראשונים to peg to either sunset or Nightfall.

The seasonal hours from sunrise to sunset is the one that directly corresponds to the Korban-equivalent of our prayers (which in the case of מנחה would be the כבש של בין הערבים), as per the proof of Rabbenu Ḥananel (citing R' Yehuda's parallel's between the rules of the שתי תמידים and when one can pray the two daytime prayers). Thus, this times פלג המנחה at 1¼ seasonal hours before sunset (as held by Talmideh Rabbenu Yonah, Berakhoth Bavli 26a; Rambam, Laws of Prayer, 3:4; Kaf Ha'Ḥayyim on O"Ḥ 233:7; Shilteh Hagiborim on the Mordekhi; R' Yitzḥak Yisraeli's explanation of the Meiri - Yoseh Binah pg. 105).

However, the definition of a day is explicitly defined as starting from Dawn and ending by Nightfall (Pesaḥim Bavli 94a), thus defining ערב (being the end-time of מנחה) as Nightfall. Within that Talmudic context, the seasonal hours would also retain that length and Nightfall would be 72 minutes long, proportionate to the 72 minutes used to start the day (as ruled by Rabbenu Tam). With both rules implemented (as ruled by the Terumat Ha'Deshen; see siman 1), the halachic midday corresponds with the sun's midpoint in its traversal (as explicitly outlined by Shu"t Divreh Yosef Shwartz pg. 58 & R' Tukachinsky in the Sefer "Ben Hashmashot", pg. 98). Nevertheless, Pelag Ha'Minḥa is independent from proportionality (as discussed in Pri Ḥadash, Kuntress Debei Shimsha, end of ספר מים חיים), hence allowing either one of those rules to be broken. This opened the door for two preceeding interpretations:

- By ignoring the extended length of a seasonal hour, the S"A & Ramban (in addition to Ra'ah, Berakhoth 26b; Ritva, Berakhoth 27b; Rabbi Yaakov Emden, Prozdor Bayit 41, paragraph 28 explicitly linking this to Shabbat's Candle Lighting) created a time for פלג המנחה that was close enough to sunset to make both terms used interchangably (see the Ramban, Pesaḥim 54b; as for the S"A, see O"Ḥ 233 for Nightfall being the endtime of מנחה as well as O"Ḥ 261 describing what Nightfall is, and the connection between "sunset" for Tosefet Shabbat to "Pelag", as the Rama implicitly outlines).
- Contemporary authorities, however, used the extended seasonal length but measured using the _Geonic_ Nightfall, thus creating a midday that's no longer defined by the midpoint of the sun's traversal (see the Ben Ish Ḥai, Year I, Vayakhel VIII; see also Ohr Letzion vol. 2 pg. 147 & the responsas of the Ma'amar Mordechai vol. 4 siman 12).

This is all a build up to the opinions of Yabi'a Omer (vol. 2 siman 21 num. 15) and his two sons - R' Avraham Yosef in his [Parashat Terumah 5779 shiur min 3:55](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/76371) as well as R Yitzḥak Yosef in multiple shiurim ([Motzei Shabbat Pesach 5779 shiur min 37](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/81670), [Motzei Shabbat Bo 5778 shiur min 25](https://torahanytime.com/lectures/55391)) & his Yalkut Yosef (new edition, siman 271, pages 139 & 144-147) - to use the Geonic Nightfall as an offset for Pelag, in both stringencies (such as by blessings in vain, when coming to ערבית and הדלקת נרות), but _also in its leniencies_ (such as the last time to eat [Seudat Shelishit] on Erev Pesaḥ - see Ḥ"'O Pesaḥ pg. 67 & pg. 199). This is also reflected in later writings of Maran zt'l himself (Ḥazon 'Ovadia Ta'anit pg. 94; Halikhot 'Olam vol. 1 pg. 223), even if he's not made mention of it by earlier sections of how seasonal hours work (Halikhot Olam, vol. 1 pg. 248). However, although there is precedent to ignore _either_ proportionality of the day for Nightfall _or_ the day's standard seasonal minutes from sunrise to sunset, this position araises questions because it does _both_ as well as not affecting any other זמן, such as listing a "מנחה קטנה י"י".

On the other end of the Yosef dynasty, R' David Yosef (אוצרות יוסף תשובה ז בסוף הלכה ברורה חלק י"ד) reasserts the original practice of Sepharadic Jews to restore the definition of פלג as an 1¼ seasonal hour offset from sunset, as a response to the questions araised from the Yabi'a Omer position. Responding to the concern that there would be potentially questionable blessings, we do not rule such when the custom is otherwise (as ruled by the Minḥat Kohen - Ma-amar II, end of 9<sup>th</sup> chapter. This is also applicable for סוף זמן תפילה, where we are not concerned for the MG"A seasonal hour calculation). However, the Halacha Berura also allows praying מנחה after sunset; although this would be fine if it was reserved as a בדיעבד ruling, the Halacha Berura relies on this time enough that one should prefer this time for minyan, even though he wouldn't use it as a reliability for the calculation of פלג המנחה.

Fun fact: Under Biblical Hebrew rules of "קטל", the proper pronounciation of פלג המנחה should transliterate to "Peleg Ha'Minḥa". Nevertheless, we've kept it "Pelag" to adhear to Hakham Ovadia's pronounciation style.
