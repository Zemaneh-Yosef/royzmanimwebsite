Enter your **location name**, ~~**ZIP Code**~~ (coming soon) or **exact-geo-coordinates** - using the template of <code>(lat, lng)</code> - in the text field below, then hit "Enter" on your keyboard/click the search icon on the left of the search bar. Auto-complete suggestions will appear as you supply more information.
- To use your GPS location, hit the green <i class="bi bi-pin-map"></i> icon and grant our page permission to access your location. (This will not work if you use a VPN or a proxy to access our website)
- Advanced geo-coordinates is the only option usable offline, as you could specify further information like timezone, location name and elevation manually.

<!-- Using a ZIP code instead of a location name will open a new menu, where you could narrow down your location from the ZIP code. This is needed to accomodate other countries that may use the same postal code, as well as ZIP codes that [cover too much ground](https://kosherjava.com/2018/09/05/zip-codes-and-zmanim-use-with-care/) -->
