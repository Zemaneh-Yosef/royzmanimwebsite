Due to the severity of חמץ, we use the Biblical seasonal hours (from Dawn until Rabbenu Tam's Nightfall) for these Rabbinic times.<span data-footnote>פרי חדש תחילת סימן תמ"ג & חזון עובדיה ב' דף ל"ז</span> Nevertheless, children may use the standard sunrise to sunset measurements of seasonal hours should they want to continue eating <span class="hebSrc">חמץ</span>.<span data-footnote>חזון עובדיה פסח א' דף ס' & ילקוט יוסף (מהדורה תשע"ה) דף תרנב</span>

###### Lunar Calculations through its Renewal (Molad) - Announcing & Birkath Ha'Levana

The "Molad" (birth) is the reappearance of the moon in the sky after the conclusion of its shape-change cycle. This is used when determining the new month, in addition to when one can say <span class="hebSrc">ברכת הלבנה</span> for that month.

The calculation of the Molad was developed by Hillel the 2<sup>nd</sup>,<span data-footnote>The previous system of interrogation was no longer possible after the dispersion of the Sanhedrin.</span> utilizing a fixed time from the previous one. It is then converted to an "hours and Ḥalakim"<span data-footnote>Each Ḥelek is 1&frasl;18<sup>th</sup> of a minute, composing 1080 individual Ḥalakim in an hour</span> format, meant to be added after the mean-time sunset<span data-footnote>Rabbi Yonah Martzabach z"l in sefer Aleh Yonah (page 35) who rejects Rav Tikuchinsky z"l's viewpoint (Ben HaShmashot page 102) to consider night in this regard as 6 fixed hours after midday of the prior day in any given time of the year.</span> of the Temple Mount's location.<span data-footnote>The mean-sunset of the Temple Mount happens at 5:39 PM/17:39 of IST (Israel Standard Timezone). The arbitrary time of 6:00 PM/18:00 IST cannot be used since it's centered around a location that is too late to include our base of the Temple Mount.</span> The Israeli Molad is then used to determine the molad everywhere else in the world, happening at the same time<span data-footnote>Rav Yosef Eliyahu Henkin z”l (Edut LeYisrael page 146b letter 15) and many many more. See Amudeh Hora'ah (vol. 4 Biur Hora'ah siman 428).</span> (timezones excluded).

The normative Sepharadic custom is to only "announce" the times derived from the molad calculation (such as when one can start saying Birkat Ha'Levana).<span data-footnote>חזון עובדיה חנוכה דף רנח</span> Communities with pre-existing traditions to announce the molad (such as Ashkenazic ones or some Sepharadic ones) should subtract seven days from our listed start time when announcing.

The Halachic range to recite recite ברכת הלבנה is from the moon's renewal until its completion (חידושה<span data-footnote>ברכות ירושלמי ט:ב</span> עד שתתמלה פגימתה<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">סנהדרין בבלי מא:</span></span>). According to the letter-of-the-law, this translates to the third day from the molad<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">משנה ברורה תכ"ו:כ'</span></span> until sunrise of the 15<sup>th</sup> day in the Jewish month.<span data-footnote>The conditions of having הנאה from the moon are not impossible to fulfill from Dawn on the 15<sup>th</sup>, leaving one with the ability to do it then if they had not done it prior. ע"ע חז"ע חנוכה עמוד שכה<br>It is important to note that here we would certainly go based on each locations respective time since this measure is not fixated on the molad rather on the date itself.</span> Nevertheless, our listed times are based on stringencies<span data-footnote>The letter-of-the-law rulings are available to use as well, whether explicit yet out of context (such as using the listed time of sunrise on the 15<sup>th</sup> day in the Jewish month - חז"ע חנוכה, עמוד שמט) or inferred through math (such as subtracting 96 hours from the listed start time). Indeed, one should use this position if the stringency would cause them to lose out on the blessing (ע"ע בחז"ע חנוכה עמוד שסג; גם עיין בכף החיים תכו:סב ואור לציון חלק ג ד:ו שחולק על מרן ז"ל)</span> that the Sepharadic tradition has adopted (whether due to Kaballa or a concern of blessings in vain), whether it's to wait _seven_ days from the molad or to determine the endtime as the midpoint between the current month's molad to the following month's molad.<span data-footnote>שו"ע או"ח סימן תכ"ו:ג' בהגאות רמ"א<br><span class="hebSrc">ראה רב פעלים ב' סימן לח, כף החיים תכו:נ & נג, אור לציון ג' פרק ד' הלכה ו'</span></span>

###### Tekufa

Our calendar's usage of the word "תקופה" refers to the quarterly solar seasons, which are Nissan/Spring, Tammuz/Summer, Tishri/Fall & Tevet/Winter. The start of a season is the end of the previous, yet the halachic rulings dependent on seasons are applied to the beginning<span data-footnote>רש”י על שמות ל”ד:כ”ב - “שֶׁהִיא בַחֲזָרַת - בִּתְחִלַּת”</span> of each one:

- The switch between ברכנו to ברך עלינו for those living outside ארץ ישראל happens 60 days into <span class="hebSrc">תקופת תשרי</span>.<span data-footnote>ש”ע או”ח קי”ז:י”א</span>

- Every 112 seasons from the initial תקופה (which happened in the month of ניסן), the sun returns to its location and season of its creation in relation to the rest of the celestrial being.<span data-footnote>ברכות בבלי נט: - "ואימת הוי אמר אביי כל כ״ח שנין...והדר מחזור ונפלה תקופת ניסן בשבתאי באורתא דתלת נגהי ארבע"<br>This is bound to time, which happens at 5:39 PM IST - the timezone-adapted version of the original "18:00"</span> Thus, the Sages enacted a blessing commemorating the occasion, to be said the following morning after the seasonal switch in Israel<span data-footnote>(even if a timezone would dictate earlier/later)</span> - we've been accustomed to recite this blessing as soon as possible in the day by praying at sunrise.<span data-footnote>חז"ע ברכות עמוד תעט.<br>If sunrise was missed, one may still recite it until the third hour</span>

- There is a Kabbalistic warning to not drink plain water at the moment the Tekufah begins,<span data-footnote>רמ”א על יורה דעה קט”ז:ה</span> for it is a time of spiritual danger.<span data-footnote>פרי חדש על ש”ע או”ח סוף סימן תכ”ח מזהיר על חשש המוות. יש גם תעם לפי פשת: לעורר אותנו בתשובה (תשובות הגאונים (מוסאפיה) סי’ י”ד)</span> We customarily developed a "time-buffer" for before and after this time, totaling in an hour where one would observe this restriction (30 minutes before and after)<span data-footnote>הליכות אולם ז' דף קפג, נהר מצרים, דף עז ע”ב, ר’ אלינו חזון בספר נוה שלום סימן קט”ז אות ה. יש הרבה מנהגים על זה, החל חצי שעה שהם ט"ו דקות לפניו ולאחריו (חיד”א, שו”ת יוסף אומץ סימן מ”ב) או שש שעות (מנהגי מהרי”ל בליקוטים של סימן נו), שהם שלושה שעות לפניו ולאחוריו. המנהג המפורסם שלא שוטים מים שעה ומחצה לפניו ולאחריו</span>

The halachic form of determining seasonal transition days is intended to be easy,<span data-footnote>Determining the length of a solar year was not in the hands of a Bet Din, whose job was to determine the calendar for the Jewish month, whether it'd be 29/30 days. Anything involving fraction manipulation is too complex, and thus we use rounded values.</span> for the sake of being ever lasting. Thus, we've compromised on the length of individual seasons<span data-footnote>The correlation between intention and application for this compromised is highlighted explicitly by R' Abraham ibn Ezra. For discussions from our Jewish authorities on the astronomical length of a season, see <i>Yesod Olam</i> by R' Yitzḥak ben Yosef<br>Our compromise is that we assume every season has a consistent length. Thus, to get between one season and another, one would simply need to take the length of a solar year divided by the amount of seasons (four) to get an individual length of a season.</span> and oversimplified the length of a solar year.<span data-footnote>The length of a solar year has been simplified by not including the exceptions to a leap year (such as every 100 years being a non-leap year unless its divisible by 400). Thus, a year is consistently 365.25 days.<br>This is commonly referred to as the Julian calendar, yet the halachic beginnings come from שמואל <span class="hebSrc">(ערובין בבלי נו.)</span>. The correlation between the intention and application is highlighted explicitly by the חזון איש in his comments on O"Ḥ Siman 138, se'if katan 4.</span> Therefore, the length of a singular season is measured at 91 days, 7 hours & 30 minutes, and by knowing when _any_ season starts, one can jump between one and the next by adding this length to that time.

The only season given as part of our heritage is the first one, which occured in the month of Nissan.<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">משנה תורה, הלכות קידוש החדש ט':ד'</span></span> Translating these Jerusalem-mean times to timezone-compatible times involves subtracting the timezone offset of _21 minutes_ from each time (6:00, 12:00, 18:00 & 24:00),<span data-footnote>Rav Aharon Boron in תנובות שדה</span> yet the practice we've tied to Eretz Yisrael reflects the custom (represented by the Ohr Hachaim calendar) to consider these times still compatible with the timezone format, without any conversion needed.<span data-footnote>Rav Tucazinsky</span> This difference only practically affects the water warning, since 30 minutes prior & following would not accommodate _both_ opinions; to be stringent for both opinions, start from the 21-minute offset and end by the fixed half-hour offset.<span data-footnote>This only affects the 30 minute shita Maran zt"l followed. Communities looking to maintain their pre-existing custom of waiting longer can stick to whatever is easier on the community, since a half-hour both prior and following has long passed according to both R' Baron and R' Tucazinsky (as well as how the basic passage of time works).</span>
