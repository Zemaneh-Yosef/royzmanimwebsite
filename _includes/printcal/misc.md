###### Ḥametz End Time

In addition to the <span class="hebSrc">איסור דאורייתא</span><span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">רמב"ם הלכות חמץ ומצה א':ח'; רא"ש פסחים סוף ב':ד' - "וכן נראה לי"</span></span> to own and derive benefit from חמץ after midday/right before בין הערבים<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">אביי בפסחים ה.</span></span> on ערב פסח, there is an additional Rabbinic safeguard by the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> seasonal hour to forbid eating חמץ and the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> seasonal hour to forbid owning <span class="hebSrc">חמץ</span>.<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">רבי יהודה במשנה פסחים א':ד', רמב"ם (סדר זמנים) הלכות חמץ ומצה א':ט'</span></span>

Although the usual method of calculating seasonal hours is from sunrise until sunset, we are stringent on חמץ to consider these two Rabbinic times through the seasonal hours normally reserved for Biblical times<span data-footnote>פרי חדש תחילת סימן תמ"ג & חזון עובדיה ב' דף ל"ז</span> (such as Keriath Shema) by calculating them from Dawn until Rabbenu Tam's Nightfall. For children, there is a leniency to use the sunrise->sunset seasonal hours if they want to still eat <span class="hebSrc">חמץ</span>.<span data-footnote>חזון עובדיה פסח א' דף ס' & ילקוט יוסף (מהדורה תשע"ה) דף תרנב</span>

###### Molad (New Moon) - Announcing & Birkath Halevana

The "Molad" (birth) is the reappearence of the moon in the sky after the conclusion of its shape-change cycle. Practically, we use them to determine the new month and when one can say <span class="hebSrc">ברכת הלבנה</span>.

The calculation of the Molad was developed by Hillel the 2<sup>nd</sup>,<span data-footnote>The previous system of interrogation was no longer possible after the dispersion of the Sanhedrin.</span> utilizing a fixed time from the previous one. It is then converted to an "hours and Ḥalakim"<span data-footnote>Each Ḥelek is 1&frasl;18<sup>th</sup> of a minute, composing 1080 individual Ḥalakim in an hour</span>, meant to be added after the mean-time sunset<span data-footnote>Rabbi Yonah Martzabach z"l in sefer Aleh Yonah (page 35) who rejects Rav Tikuchinsky z"l's viewpoint (Ben HaShmashot page 102) to consider night in this regard as 6 fixed hours after midday of the prior day in any given time of the year.</span> of the Temple Mount's location.<span data-footnote>The mean-sunset of the Temple Mount happens at 5:39 PM/17:39 of IST (Israel Standard Timezone). The arbitrary time of 6:00 PM/18:00 IST cannot be used since it's centered around a location that is too late to include our base of the Temple Mount.</span> The Israeli Molad is then used to determine the molad everywhere else in the world, happening at the same time<span data-footnote>Rav Yosef Eliyahu Henkin z”l (Edut LeYisrael page 146b letter 15) and many many more. See Amudeh Hora'ah (vol. 4 Biur Hora'ah siman 428).</span> (timezones excluded).

The practice of Ashkenazic communities (as well as some Sepharadic ones) is to announce the result of this formula during ברכת החדש. However, we omit this information in our calendar due to it not being part of the normative Sepharadic custom.<span data-footnote>חזון עובדיה חנוכה דף רנח</span> Communities looking to continue their tradition of announcing it should instead subtract 7 days from our listed time to start saying Birkat Halevana.

The Halachic range for when one can recite ברכת הלבנה is from the moon's renewal until it is full (חידושה<span data-footnote>ברכות ירושלמי ט:ב</span> עד שתתמלה פגימתה<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">סנהדרין בבלי מא:</span></span>). The practical letter-of-the-law interpretation is from the third day following the molad<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">משנה ברורה תכ"ו:כ'</span></span> until sunrise of the 15<sup>th</sup> day.<span data-footnote>The conditions of having הנאה from the moon are not impossible to fulfill from Dawn on the 15<sup>th</sup>, leaving one with the ability to do it if they had not done it prior. ע"ע חז"ע חנוכה אמוד שכה</span> Nevertheless, the Sepharadic tradition<span data-footnote>שו"ע (או"ח) תכו:ד</span> is to wait until the _seventh_ day from the molad to start, as long as one would not lose out on the blessing.<span data-footnote>Ḥazon Ovadya (Ḥannuka page 363). See, Kaf HaChaim (426 62) & Ohr LeTzion (vol. 3 chapter 4 law 6) who disagree with this leniency.</span> Since there is a question of ברכה לבטלה, other Sepharadic authorities have been stringent to determine the moon's fullness using the midpoint between the current month's molad to the next month's molad.<span data-footnote>שו"ע או"ח סימן תכ"ו:ג' בהגאות רמ"א<br><span class="hebSrc">ראה רב פעלים ב' סימן לח, כף החיים תכו:נ & נג, אור לציון ג' פרק ד' הלכה ו'</span></span> We list only these strict times, yet those looking for the earlier times should subtract 4 days from our listed time to start saying ברכת הלבנה, and use the Dawn entry on the 15<sup>th</sup> day for the later end time.<span data-footnote>Ḥazon Ovadya (Ḥannuka page 349). It is important to note that here we would certainly go based on each locations respective time since this measure is not fixated on the molad rather on the date itself.</span>

###### Tekufa

Tekufot are the Halachic equivalents of the yearly solar seasons, which we have four of yearly; Nissan/Spring, Tamuz/Summer, Tishri/Fall & Tevet/Winter. There are practical concepts that depend on when the beginning<span data-footnote>רש”י על שמות ל”ד:כ”ב - “שֶׁהִיא בַחֲזָרַת - בִּתְחִלַּת”</span> of each Tekufa falls out:

{:.fakeListItem}
Outside ארץ ישראל, we switch the text of תפילת שמונה עשרי from ברכנו to ברך עלינו after 60 days into Tekufat Tishri.<span data-footnote>ש”ע או”ח קי”ז:י”א</span> Although this currently corresponds to December 4<sup>th</sup> (or December 5<sup>th</sup>), this will drift outside of those days as the years go.

{:.fakeListItem}
There is a Kabbalistic warning to not drink plain water at the moment the Tekufah begins,<span data-footnote>רמ”א על יורה דעה קט”ז:ה</span> for it is a time of spiritual danger.<span data-footnote>פרי חדש על ש”ע או”ח סוף סימן תכ”ח מזהיר על חשש המוות. יש גם תעם לפי פשת: לעורר אותנו בתשובה (תשובות הגאונים (מוסאפיה) סי’ י”ד)</span> We customarily developed a "time-buffer" for before and after this time, totaling in an hour where one would observe this restriction (30 minutes before and after)<span data-footnote>הליכות אולם ז' דף קפג, נהר מצרים, דף עז ע”ב, ר’ אלינו חזון בספר נוה שלום סימן קט”ז אות ה. יש הרבה מנהגים על זה, החל חצי שעה שהם ט"ו דקות לפניו ולאחריו (חיד”א, שו”ת יוסף אומץ סימן מ”ב) או שש שעות (מנהגי מהרי”ל בליקוטים של סימן נו), שהם שלושה שעות לפניו ולאחוריו. המנהג המפורסם שלא שוטים מים שעה ומחצה לפניו ולאחריו</span>

{:.fakeListItem}
Once every 28 years, we recite a special blessing thanking God for creating the sun when it returns to the same time<span data-footnote>This is at 18:00, which translates into 5:39 PM IST.</span> and place that it occupied when it was created. This is done on the morning after Israel's<span data-footnote>(even if a timezone would dictate earlier/later)</span> Tekufath Nisan, where everyone prays by sunrise to recite the blessing as soon as they can.<span data-footnote>Ḥazon Ovadia Berakhot pg. 479. Those who could not do it by then should still try to do it by the third hour</span>

Finding out which days mark the start of a season is as easy as knowing when one of them is and just adding/subtracting the length of a season.

{:.fakeListItem}
The length of a season is determined by taking the length of the year divided by four. Since we hold<span data-footnote>שמואל (Bavli Eruvin, 56a). As the Ḥazon Ish (O"Ḥ Siman 138, se'if katan 4) explains, things that each person should calculate for themselves use rounded values, like for the diameter of a Sukkah.</span> that a year is 365.25 days, dividing that into four gives us a season’s length of 91 days, 7 hours and 30 minutes.

{:.fakeListItem}
The first season (as indicated by when we say ברכת החמה) is for the month of Nisan, which is used as our reference point.<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">משנה תורה, הלכות קידוש החדש ט':ד'</span></span> When translating these clock-times (6:00 AM, 12:00, 18:00 & 24:00) into timezone-based times, there is a dispute whether these are using Har Habayit's timezone offset of -21 minutes (as the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar subscribes to<span data-footnote>Rav Aharon Boron in תנובות שדה</span>) or sticking to the IST-based times (as the Ohr Hachaim calendar subscribes to<span data-footnote>Rav Tucazinsky</span>). The only area where this actually makes a difference is the water-warning, yet it's possible to accomodate both by starting the fast using R' Boron's time and ending using R' Tucazinsky's time.<span data-footnote>This only affects the 30 minute shita Maran zt"l followed. Communities looking to maintain their pre-existing custom of waiting longer can stick to whatever is easier on the community, since a half-hour both prior and following has long passed according to both R' Baron and R' Tucazinsky (as well as how the basic passage of time works).</span>
