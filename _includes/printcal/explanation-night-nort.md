###### Night (Three Stars)

Prior to the time of Nightfall, there is a transition period of twilight called בן השמשות, where it is either day or night (possibly even both).<span data-footnote>Matters of stringency from either day of the transition would apply during this time. As such, the day "extends" beyond the 24 hour limit to include <i>both</i> day's twilight periods.<br>Nevertheless, obligations that one couldn't do throughout the day could be done during this transition period, such as the latest time to pray תפילת מנחה (Y"Y 235:5), wear תפילין or shake the דלת מינים.</span> As soon as three stars are visible,<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">שבת בבלי לה:</span></span> Nightfall comes to end the transition and usher in the new halachic day. All of the new day's obligation start from this moment, specifically ones that impact the night.<span data-footnote>Examples of such include reading the night's קריאת שמע (S.A. 235 1), reading the מגילה on Purim, checking for חמץ on ערב פסח amongst others</span>

The calculated letter-of-the-law time of twilight is as short as 13½ [adjusted-]seasonal minutes<span data-footnote>הליכות עולם (ח"א עמוד רנ), חזון עובדיה (יו"ט עמוד רלב ודש; ארבע תעניות עמוד טו; חנוכה עמוד עג)</span> after sunset.<span data-footnote>Some may wonder: How is it possible for three stars to be visible in such a short time after sunset? Several authorities explain that the sign of stars is indeed not so easily discernable to the average person (even with good vision and visibility of the stars) because they are miniscule points within a broad picture, requiring even a faint star to be fixated on (while knowing where it would even first appear) prior to being able to discern it (ספר "לילה ויום של תורה" דף קע"ה והזמנים בהלכה ב' דפים תפ"ח-תצ"ג) in contrast to the vastly large sky background (יביע אומר ז' מ"א:ז' בשם גרא"ז, פני יהושע, גר"א). Light pollution is also a factor, which means that those living in cities are simply unable to see three stars immediately as they emerge.</span> Nevertheless, the extended time of בין השמשות (that being 20 minutes)<span data-footnote>רמב"ם הלכות תרומות ז:ב</span> is used for letter-of-the-law Biblical rulings,<span data-footnote>Examples include determining the day of a ברית מילה if a baby was born on Friday Night, and the tevilah time for a Nidah. However, this is non-applicable for starting the Passover Seder; <i>any</i> delay is a leniency in the commandment of והגדת לבנך.</span> as well as the <i>recommended</i> time to end a Rabbinic fast<span data-footnote>חזון עובדיה ארבע צומות דף יב.</span>. Both calendars modes calculate this differently: While the Amudeh Hora'ah calendar chooses to list this daily and calculate the time through its (adjusted-)seasonal minutes, the Ohr Hachaim calendar simplifies this to only show by days which require this stringency (such as fasts) and calculates these minutes as fixed 60 seconds.

The end time of שבת is not only dependent on Nightfall,<span data-footnote>To avoid any potential acts of descecration, we have chosen to hide the regular nightfall time time for any Shabbat/Yom Tov. Those looking to use it for legitimate purposes (such as the latest time one could start שעודת שלישית בדיעבד) should look to applying this time *from the prior/following day* (whichever is more stringent).</span> as there is an additional time of <span class="hebMidWord">תוספת שבת</span><span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">שו"ע או"ח רצ"ג:א'</span></span> on top of the <i>extended</i> time of <span class="hebMidWord">בין השמשות</span>. Codifying the additional time encompassed astronomical considerations,<span data-footnote>The Shulḥan Arukh rules (<span class="hebMidWord">או"ח רצ"ג:ב'</span>) one should refrain from any <i>melakha</i> until there is no doubt left, specifically <b>astronomical</b> doubts.</span> since the legal time of Strict-Nightfall during the winter month happens much earlier than its astronomical equivalent (as explained in the "seasonal hour" section). This can be done by either creating an all-encompasing number for the whole year (such as the "Ohr Hachaim" calendar's 30 fixed minutes for ארץ ישראל),<span data-footnote>See Yehave Da'at (vol. 7 siman 56) Yalkut Yosef (New Edition siman 293 page 715). See Zivchey Tzedek (vol. 2 y.d. siman 17 page 66 & vol. 3 siman 104 page 198).</span> or determining its equivalent through scientific methods each Shabbat/Yom Tov independently. We have done the later for locations outside ארץ ישראל, through the use of "degrees" (which measures how far below the horizon the sun is positioned at).<span data-footnote>We determined the respective "degree" below the horizon after waiting 30 minutes (see above) on the equinox day in ארץ ישראל, allowing us to apply the "degree" (7.14º) anywhere.<br>Although there is precedent to use methods that would result in even shorter times (ילקוט טהרה מכתב עז), we have used this stricter measurement to ensure one would not be more lenient than the printed Ohr Hachaim calendar when applied to ארץ ישראל.</span>

As one extends their Shabbat past our time of Nightfall, a side-effect occurs where one would accommodate alternative interpretations on Nightfall. One wanting to be strict can go as far as to accommodate **Rabbenu Tam**'s interpretation on the start of בין השמשות and צאת הכוכבים,<span data-footnote>יביע עומר ב' סימן כ"א</span> followed by a majority of early authorities, the Shulḥan Arukh<span data-footnote>או"ח סימן רס"א:ב.<br>Although we have accepted the rulings of the Shulḥan Arukh, we kept our minhag that predated the acceptance of the Shulḥan Arukh. In our discussion, the minhag has already been established like the Geonim, who've solved the "contradiction in Gemara's" by either timelining each position of R' Yehuda (Maram Alashkar 94, quoting Teshuvat HaGeonim) or dismissing it as an astronomic time (גר"א על שו"ע או"ח סימן רס"א)</span> and the pious of Sepharadim.<span data-footnote>ראה באור לציון ד' פרק כ' הערה ב' וגם השיטות שבמקורות של מוצאי שבת</span> This form of Nightfall only happens **72 seasonal minutes** after sunset.<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">פסחים בבלי צד.</span></span><br>
Nevertheless, various alternative interpretations of this stringency can be factored to provide leniencies to this position (which is already a stringency, since the legal position follows the 13½ [adjusted-]seasonal minutes opinion)<span data-footnote>These leniencies cannot be applied to the Geonic times, since the letter-of-the-law position has <i>not</i> yet been followed.</span> when held for the purposes of Nightfall itself.<span data-footnote>This is meant to exclude the method of calculating a Biblical seasonal hour; those rely on proportionate times, meaning the 72 seasonal minutes for Dawn will be the same 72 seasonal minutes for Nightfall.</span> The leniency we have applied for users outside ארץ ישראל was to limit the time to 72 fixed minutes when they exceeded 72 seasonal minutes.<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">ילקוט יוסף (מהדורה חדשה) סימן רצ"ג עמוד תשכד; הלכה ברורה, הקדמת לסימן רס"א הלכה י"ט; יודעי בינה ז':ו'</span><br>Those wanting to undo this leniency can measure the time from Dawn until sunrise and wait that amount of time after sunset to get the resulting 72 seasonal minutes equivalent.</span> Another applicable leniency would be to exclude the time period of בן השמשות from the finalized time,<span data-footnote>ילקוט יוסף (מהדורה תשנ"ב) סימן רצ"ג הלכה ה</span> using a double doubt.
