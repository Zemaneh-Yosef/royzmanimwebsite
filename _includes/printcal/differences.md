###### Seasonal Hours + Twilight (Dawn/Nightfall)

The day is measured from sunrise to sunset and divided into twelve even "seasonal hours", each shortened/extended depending on how short/long the day is. This measurement is used for all Halachic times, whether throughout the day itself _or even the times of twilight_. This makes the length of twilight _shorter_ during the winter months than during the spring/fall months, unlike astronomy (represented through other calendars "degree" listings) dictating that they should be _longer_ in those months. However, the longest astronomical twilights happen during the summer season, which are also when the days are longer (and thus these halachic twilights will adjust accordingly).

These are some expection to the default measurement, though, where we will opt for other measurements that provide different results:

- A lengthier seasonal hour (from Dawn until Rabbenu Tam's Nightfall) is either enforced or encouraged for matters of strict Biblical restriction.
- A 30 fixed-minute minimum is used for Minḥa Gedolah, making a difference in the winter months
- Matters dependent on societal recognition does not depend on season, hence making them always fixed. This includes additional Shabbat time (20 minutes before sunset for candle lighting, 10 minutes after Nightfall for Shabbat ending) as well as the time-window to light Hanuka candles.

Outside of Eretz Yisrael, a few other changes are made:

- Tzet Shabbat/Yom Tov outside Eretz Yisrael confines to purely astronomical sightings, by measuring the sun's position below the horizon 30 minutes after sunset on March 20th in Eretz Yisrael. We then match that spot for every day of the year in every location, in turn making Tzet Shabbat/Yom Tov as stringent as possible.
- The twilight times are extended/shrunk on the equinox day (and thus affecting all other days) to match the sun's positioning in Eretz Yisrael on said equinox day. The result of such math when applied in Eretz Yisrael makes no difference (as it is still 72 seasonal minutes), yet this detail lets the seasonal minutes factor astronomy while still keeping the defining detail of being shorter in the winter months.
- Rabbenu Tam's Nightfall is capped at 72 fixed minutes, based on both R' Yitzḥak Yosef & R' David Yosef's ruling.

The measurements of the day are divided into 40 individual mil, which we hold is 18 minutes each. Thereby, ¾<sup>th</sup> of a mil is 13 ½ minutes (used for Geonim's nightfall) and 4 mil is 72 minutes (used for dawn and R"T's nightfall). For special occasions (such as ending a fast), we would switch to the Rambam's mil equivalence of 24 minutes, making it's rounded up ¾<sup>th</sup> value as 20 minutes after sunset.

###### Sunrise/Sunset

These are both astronomical constants, as the base to the other times. Internally, they will use the **NOAA algorithm** with elevation (except for outside Eretz Yisrael), yet sunrise will display a different time: non-elevation sunrise. This is closer to the intended result of "Visual Sunrise", scrapeable from the ChaiTables.com website. Users who did scrape these times (by following the instructions on the website by the sunrise description) will see seconds added to the "Sunrise" column.

###### Midday

Everyday is counted *independently* (as opposed to a mean value), being the halfway point between sunrise->sunset (not sunrise->tzet)

###### Pelag Haminḥa

In addition to the GR"A's Pelag Haminḥa (held by Maran Ovadia in Halichot Olam & R' David in Halacha Berura), we offer the time for Pelag Haminḥa according to R' Yitzḥak Yosef & R' Avraham Yosef. This retains the GR"A's seasonal minutes while counting backwards from the Geonic nightfall (which as established above is 13 ½ minutes after sunset).

###### Tekufot

This is a concept no other calendar lists, and explaining it here would require documenting the entire practice (which is too long for our purposes). Please reference the back of the PDF for an explanation.

###### Birkat Halevana
Between Sepharadim and Ashkenazim, we start later (because we start by day 7 rather than day 3) and end later. Whereas starting later is just whatever time we start + 96 hours, we end later because we say Birkat Halevana throughout the night of the 15th while the Rama wants to match the molad.

###### Molad
Although Ashkenazic (+ some Sepharadic) communities announce the specific time that the molad takes place, we ommited this formula as per the normative Minhag Eretz Yisrael.
