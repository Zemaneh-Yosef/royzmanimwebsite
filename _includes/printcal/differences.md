###### Seasonal Hours + Dawn/Nightfall

We use the length of the day from sunrise until sunset to determine all Halachic times, whether within the day or *times before sunrise/after sunset*. This means that, just like degree calculations (and unlike some calendars that used fixed minutes), these times are longer in the summer; that's because the days are longer in the summer. However, unlike both degrees calculation (for times outside sunrise->sunset) and fixed minutes, these times are *shorter* in the winter months, despite astronomy dictating that these times should be longer for times outside the day's length. There are a few exceptions, though, when we use other methods of calculation (dawn->nightfall seasonal, degrees, fixed) instead of seasonal sunrise->sunset times:

- Keriath Shema & Hametz use seasonal time calculated from Dawn until Nightfall
- Minḥa Gedolah uses a fixed 30 minute minimum, for the winter months
- Candle Lighting times are using fixed minutes before sunset, due to the entire concept being based on recognition for Shabbat. We use 20 fixed minutes, based on rounding up a mil's length (discussed later on).
- Tzet Shabbat uses 30 fixed minutes, which should always include time for tosefet and factors in the astronomy for Eretz Yisrael itself

Outside of Eretz Yisrael, a few other changes are made:

- Tzet Shabbat outside Eretz Yisrael confines to purely astronomical sightings, so we measure the sun's position below the horizon 30 minutes after sunset on March 20th. We then match that spot for every day of the year in every location, in turn making Shabbat the most stringent whenever possible.
- For all other times, the expected position of the sun must match for times outside sunrise->sunset **on the equinox day**. In turn, these expand/shrink the amount of minutes for Dawn/Nightfall, continuing the minutes parallel (at least for one day) while keeping the minutes seasonal for the other days of the year.
- Rabbenu Tam's Nightfall is capped at 72 fixed minutes, based on both R' Yitzḥak Yosef & R' David Yosef's ruling.

The Talmudic way of referring to the measurement behind these times is a "mil", which we hold is 18 minutes. Thereby, ¾<sup>th</sup> of a mil is 13 ½ minutes (used for Geonim's nightfall) and 4 mil is 72 minutes (used for dawn and R"T's nightfall). For special occasions (such as ending a fast), we would switch to the Rambam's mil equivalence of 24 minutes, making it's rounded up ¾<sup>th</sup> value as 20 minutes after sunset.

###### Sunrise/Sunset

These are both astronomical constants, as the base to the other times. Internally, they will use the **NOAA algorithm** with elevation (except for outside Eretz Yisrael), yet sunrise will display a different time: non-elevation sunrise. This is closer to the intended result of "Visual Sunrise", scrapeable from the ChaiTables.com website. Users who did scrape these times (by following the instructions on the website by the sunrise description) will see seconds added to the "Sunrise" column.

###### Midday

Everyday is counted *independently* (as opposed to a mean value), being the halfway point between sunrise->sunset (not sunrise->tzet)

###### Plag Haminḥa

In addition to the GR"A's Plag Haminḥa (held by Maran Ovadia in Halichot Olam & R' David in Halacha Berura), we offer the time for Plag Haminḥa according to R' Yitzḥak Yosef & R' Avraham Yosef. This retains the GR"A's seasonal minutes while counting backwards from the Geonic nightfall (which as established above is 13 ½ minutes after sunset).

###### Tekufot

This is a concept no other calendar lists, and explaining it here would require documenting the entire practice (which is too long for our purposes). Please reference the back of the PDF for an explanation.

###### Birkat Halevana
Between Sepharadim and Ashkenazim, we start later (because we start by day 7 rather than day 3) and end later. Whereas starting later is just whatever time we start + 96 hours, we end later because we say Birkat Halevana throughout the night of the 15th while the Rama wants to match the molad.

###### Molad
Although Ashkenazic (+ some Sepharadic) communities announce the specific time that the molad takes place, we ommited this formula as per the normative Minhag Eretz Yisrael.
