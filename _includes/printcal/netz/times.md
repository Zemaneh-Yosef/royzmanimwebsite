<h6>Dawn - <span class="hebMidWord">עלות<span data-footnote>Genesis 32:25. Variant of וכמו השחר עלה is used in Genesis 19:15</span>/<span class="hebMidWord">עמוד</span><span data-footnote>משנה ברכות א:א</span> השחר</span></h6>

Dawn begins the halachic day, signified by the visibility of the sun's rays in the illuminated eastern sky.<span data-footnote>רא"ש, ברכות ד:א; רמב"ם פירוש המשניות ד:א; ש"ע א"ח פט:א</span> It's the moment that transitions from the night's commandments (examples: תיקון רחל,<span data-footnote>Not included in this rule is תיקון לאה, which could be said even after Dawn since it is only מזמורי תהילים. On the otherhand, the full seder of תיקון רחל should only be said prior to Dawn. (הליכות עולם א' פרשת וישלח הלכה ו; שו"ת איש מצליח חלק א סימן ד)<br>The permissibility to say תיקון רחל in the time surrounding Dawn is subject to great dispute. Concluding within the half hour prior to Dawn is permitted considering our ability to determine whether the Dawn has risen to the precise minute (negating the concern of רב פעלים חלק ב או"ח סעיף ב. This letter-of-the-law ruling was represented in בא"ח א וישלח הלכה ח). On the other hand, saying it after dawn is forbidden from the words of the Zohar (as repeated in משפת כתוב ס"א, quoted in י"י (מהדורא תשפ"א) א:מח (אמוד פא)), meaning one should not say it even during the time until Misheyakir (against שו"ת יצחק ירנן ח"א סי' כ"ז & responsa attributed by RYY to שו"ת איש מצליח).</span> קריאת שמע של ערבית & תפילת ערבית) to the days commandments (like not eating before prayer<span data-footnote>ש"ע או"ח פט:ה</span>), even if not a full-proof perfect one. This is because there are cases where the night's commandments (קריאת שמע בלי ברכת השכיבנו) could still be done into the day, and practically, one should still not perform positive commandments (such as prayer) until sunrise (unless there is a pressing circumstance. Also, one who erroneously did any commandment before sunrise is exempt post-facto).

These Halachic times are determined not through what our eyes see (whether the sky correlates to the astronomical description of Dawn above), but rather through measurements. On the average day,<span data-footnote>Each day is measured by its length from sunrise to sunset, making the average when the day spans 12 hours. This will cause the night to also span 12 hours, allowing for a description of Dawn before any adjustments for the differing sun movements throughout the seasons</span> one could measure the length of the day from sunrise to sunset, break them up into smaller units<span data-footnote>The Talmud (פסחים בבלי צד) instead used the space measurement unit of "mil", converted to the amount of time it took the average person to walk said space of 2000 *Amot* long. (Sourcing involves math from S"A O"Ḥ 261:2, which says that 75%/3&frasl;4<sup>th</sup>'s of a singular mil is 1500 *Amot*)</span> and use math-variables to fill in the blanks caused by twilight.<span data-footnote>Twilight is a time period that's used either within or in addition to (debate between the Bet Yosef & the GR"A, irrelevant for our discussion here even though it's relevant to defining a seasonal hour) the measurements of day, even though it's outside of the range from sunrise to sunset.</span>

In our case, there are two variables: the length of our measuring unit, multiplied by a separate variable that'll determine how much of this measuring unit one should extend outwards from our sunrise->sunset measurement.<span data-footnote>The map of the day includes two of these twilight periods; one before the sunrise and one after the sunset. This second time period of twilight maintains the same length as the morning's, concluding with "צאת כל הכוכבים" (GR"A on S"A O"Ḥ 261). However, the practicality of this later twilight from our text of the Gemara is to determine the morning's twilight length. The GR"A (ibid) negates any legal perspective for this second twilight, whereas R' Hai Gaon & R' Sherira Gaon suggests (quoted in Teshuvot Maharam Alashkar 96) that there was an initial legal outcome of the night's twilight, until R Yehuda himself revolked that by the time he concluded his ruling (<span class="hebSrc">שבת בבלי לד:</span>).<br>
The third interpretation comes from Rabbenu Tam, who includes the legal time of "Ben Hashemashot" (time of doubt whether its day or night, lasting 3&frasl;4<sup>th</sup>'s of a mil) within the end of the night's twilight. With the basis of the assertion being that there is a parallel in the twilights in the legal world as well, the Ḥatam Sofer (commentary on S"A O"Ḥ 89, MG"A 2) adds onto the parallel's by introducing a "Ben Hashemashot" at the start of Dawn. Practically, this means the day's certain beginning only starts after Dawn, introducing a new time into the morning's routine. (One possible explanation is given by the Yalkut Yosef (5781 Edition) O"Ḥ II, pg 464, distinguishing between "שיאיר פני כל המזרח" and "שהבריק השחר כנקודה בלבד", based on the Mishna Berurah 89:2). Nevertheless, both the premise law and the extrapolated law contradict our tradition of there being no resemblance in the conclusion of the "Talmudic contradiction" between the times post-sunset and pre-dawn, instead giving clear singular definitions to both Dawn and sunset.</span> The converted time of each unit is **18 minutes**,<span data-footnote>ש"ע או"ח תנט:ב</span> deducable from how many minutes there are in that day (12\*60=720) divided by how many mil a day has (720/40=18). Concluding unlike Rava (based on Rabbi Yoḥanan),<span data-footnote>They maintain that "5 mil" is used for each period of twilight, practically converting that to 1&frasl;8<sup>th</sup> of the day's length with our mil count</span> Rabbi Yehuda leaves enough room for a twilight time of **72 minutes**.<span data-footnote>This is 1&frasl;10<sup>th</sup> of the day's length</span> Dawn then happens at the beginning of that twilight period.

The codification of this law from our authorities views the context (Israel on Erev Pesaḥ<span data-footnote>This refers to the spring equinox, where the length of day & night is symmetric to each other. Lengths of each are shortened/extended depending on how far one is from this day and it's fall counterpart on September 20<sup>th</sup>.</span>) as a means to create an astronomical parallel<span data-footnote>Specifically, the sun's position below the horizon, measurable at 16.04 degrees</span> to the passage of time; however, when the parameters change (such as the different days of the calendar or different locations than Israel), we maintain the time length of twilight would also accommodate.<span data-footnote>This is unlike those that codified the concluded time itself irrespective of any astronomical inconsistency (whether summer or winter), in the form of "fixed minutes". According to these opinions, 72 minutes would be the same 72 minutes through any location on any day of the year. For further research, read the following:<br>תוספות הראש (ברכות ג: ד"ה כיון), מור וקציעה (ריש ס רל"ג) ודרך החיים (הלכות ערב שבת). גם גרסאות המדויקות של הרמב"ם (גרסת רב יוסף קאפח)</span>

Recreating the context of the Gemara is as easy as applying the sun's position ("degree") below the horizon on the equinox day at those minutes to the respective location.<span data-footnote>Halacha Berura (intro to siman 261 halacha 13), based on Minḥath Kohen (2 4) & Bet David (104). Although R' David writes only within the context of increasing these minutes for locations more north, decreasing to accommodate the astronomy for areas more south remains consistent (use for leniencies argued by Pri Ḥadash, Kuntres DeBey Shimshey 8)</span> One could then measure the time that this astronomical event takes place until sunrise to get the length of twilight fitting for that location. To fit it with the normative Sepharadic custom, this twilight period is then lengthened/shortened depending on how long the day itself lasts, in a process called "seasonal minutes".<span data-footnote>מנחת כהן (מבוא השמש מאמר ב פרק ג) על שו"ת פאר הדור 44. זה פסק של מרן עובדיה, והביא ראיה מבא"ח (שנא ראשונה - וארא ה, ויקהל ד, צב ח; שנא שניא - נח ז; רב פעלים ב:ב), וכן הסכים הילקוט יוסף (נ"ח:ג)<br>This binding of twilight's length to specific locations would perfectly match the sun's astronomy if one factors the sun's movement below the horizon each individual day, similar to the typical depiction of "degrees" (adopted even by other Sepharadic authorities, such as R' Mazuz in the Kisse Raḥamim calendar & R' Ya'akov Hillel in the Ahavat Shalom calendar). Nevertheless, our minutes shrink during the winter seasons, which is contradictory to the actual astronomy (where the length of astronominal twilight are longer during the winter than the spring/fall seasons, even if they are shorter than the summer's twilight).</span>

The calendar times generated using our formula may result in either a leniency or a stringency, dependent on the scenario & the other time used in the comparsion. Due to the nature of how reliant we are on our time, *any* other formula that would generate more comfortable/lenient times may **not** be used to supersede our "stringencies", considering they use premises not adopted by our authorities.<span data-footnote>י"י (מהדורת תשפ"א) עמוד תעה סימן פט:יב<br>Although the inverse is also true (that their authorities would not rely on our results), our authorities have held of our times even when it was visibly more lenient - פרי חדש על המנחת כהן (שמנ"כ לא רצה לפי דעתו לסמוך על זמניות לקולא אבל הפר"ח הסכים גם לקולא). נפסוק להלכה בספרי מרן עובדיה (למעלה), אור לציון (ח"ב עמ' נב) וכף החיים (י"ח סעיף קטן י"ח)</span>. However, there are cases where we introduce further leniencies, whether due to an inaccessibility to our opinions or when our opinion is too stringent:

- Those unable to pray תפילת שחרית from sunrise until the 4<sup>th</sup> hour (such as workers) may pray from ברוך שאמר until ישתבח as early as Dawn (even <span class="hebMidWord">לכתחילה</span>).<span data-footnote>י"י (מהדורת תשפ"א) עמוד תעד סימן פט:יא</span> In those cases, one may also start <span class="hebMidWord">קרבנות</span><span data-footnote>Although one would read the verse of "שמע ישראל" before the time one would be able to put Tefilin on, there is no concern of reading the קרבנות without one's Tefilin since the statement of "כל הקורא קריאת שמע בלא תפילין כאילו מעיד עדות שקר בעצמו" is limited to the testifying parts of טלית ותפילין, which aren't found in the verse we say above (Halikhot 'Olam I pg. 17, disproving the BI"Ḥ I Vaera II)</span> as early as 90<span data-footnote>see YY above; also Yeḥave Da'at - vol. II siman 8. There are two ways we've reached 90 minutes:<br>a) Increasing the length of a mil to 22.5 minutes. (Ḥatam Sofer)<br>b) Increasing the mil count used for Dawn, as תוספות incidentally holds (somehow, their commentary to <span class="hebSrc">ברכות בבלי ב:</span> includes a time of 5 mil)<br><br>Any earlier time would utilize a mil's length of 24 minutes (used by <span class="hebSrc">רמב"ם, פירוש משניות פסחים ג:ב סוף ד"ה בצק</span>), which is unsuitable when applied to the Talmud's description of the equinox-day.<br>The astronomical sightings are represented through math, where the length of a mil is a variable that affects all others. In our case, the length of a 24-mil changes the twilight period's to last 5 mil, since the days length of 720 minutes (12 hours of daylight multiplied by 60 minutes per hour) could only give us 30 of the 24-minute mil (24\*30). This does not correlate to any astronomical sighting, considering the first glimmer of light appears much later than 120 minutes before dawn, specifically when the sun is at 18&deg;. Furthermore, we appeal to the Gemara's later authority, who concluded that there can only be 4 mil for the twilight periods.<br><br>As such, we forego the 24 minute mil altogether for Dawn (which isn't against the Rambam, since even the Rambam held that Dawn is measured at 72 minutes; ע"ע פירוש משניות א:א) and use the closest available position, held at 90 minutes.</span> seasonal<span data-footnote>There is no reason to suggest that anything beyond the length of a mil is subject to sacrifice.</span> minutes before sunrise, since there is no concern of ספק ברכות להקל before ברוך שאמר.
- One who has not counted the עומר and is unsure whether Dawn has risen can count even with a blessing.<span data-footnote>This ruling is derived from a ספק ספיקא:<br>a) Perhaps it is still night, where it is permissible to count; this can manifest whether one is before Dawn or it's during a period of "בן השמשות" according to the authorities that rule such exists in the morning's twilight.<br>b) Perhaps the law goes like the Beraitah that permits counting with a blessing even into the morning.<br><br>This ruling is sourced R' Avraham Yosef, Halacha Yomit shiur on Nissan 28, 5783 (TorahAnytime ID 131578). Although it was initially presented as three doubts, we merged the first two based on the Halacha Berura's ruling not to overpopulate cases in ספק ספיקא when the two doubts returns the same result.</span>

The following leniencies are also applicable to other times in the calendar

- When using adjusted-seasonal minutes outside israel/regular seasonal minutes in Israel, the differences between degree-calculated time and ours is very minimal in the summer months. Thereby, assuming their Dawn degree is determined using 72 minutes as a base, their calendar's results can be used from March 20<sup>th</sup> until September 20<sup>th</sup>
- One stuck with a calendar with the right times from a different year can be used by adding or subtracting one day לחומרה, as long as the calendar is within 30 years of the present time.<span data-footnote>Dvar Yom (R Dovid Braunfeld), pg. 268<br>The change of each year's zemanim is not dependent on how distant it is from a specific year; rather, it is based on the cycle of the leap years in the Gregorian calendar.</span>

###### Misheyakir

As mentioned above, Dawn is the time one can start receiting the blessings of פסוקי דזימרה. However, the order of תפילה also consists of קריאת שמע and its surrounding blessings, which require a later time called **Misheyakir**.<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">משנה ברכות א:ב - "מִשֶּׁיַּכִּיר בֵּין תְּכֵלֶת לְלָבָן."</span><br>The Talmud (<span class="hebSrc">ברכות בבלי ט:</span>) restates other comparisons, concluding with "אָמַר רַב הוּנָא: הֲלָכָה כַּאֲחֵרִים. אָמַר אַבָּיֵי: לִתְפִילִּין כַּאֲחֵרִים. לִקְרִיאַת שְׁמַע כְּוָתִיקִין". [Aḥerim in our case holds by "מִשֶּׁיִּרְאֶה אֶת חֲבֵרוֹ רָחוֹק אַרְבַּע אַמּוֹת, וְיַכִּירֶנּוּ", which is a different way of referring to the same time in our Mishna; see Yerushalmi 1:2, as codified by the בית יוסף commentary to the Tur (O"Ḥ 58:2)]. The majority of our foremost authorities (Rambam in Mishne Tora, Laws of Keriath Shema, 1:11 & Rif) codified Abaye's ruling against our Mishna, thereby obmitting any element of Misheyakir. However, Maran (S"A O"Ḥ 58) held by the other foremost authority (the Rosh, Berakhoth 1:10 & Rabbenu Yona ibid), who maintained the Mishna's law by contextualizing Abaye's ruling as an addition (meaning to add an element of priority) rather than a replacement to the Mishna's ruling.<br>Reciting קריאת שמע by a בדיעבד time calls the fulfillment of the מצוה into question, and opens the opportunity for a redo. Although Maran agrees that there is a בדיעבד time, the window of time is much smaller since the time of משיכיר elevates the מצוה to a לכתחילה, even though it is not מצוה מן המובחר. This detail changes not only the need of a redo, but also the opportunity of a redo; attempting to fulfill the מצוה twice (as long as both attempts are within the same לכתחילה and בדיעבד status) transgresses the commandment of not adding to the word of law (בל תוסיף).</span> The description of this time is when one can recognize a semi-familiar acquaintence within the distance of 4 *Amot*/6 feet, and distinguish between white & tekhelet. Once this time comes, one can also put on the other two dependents of this time; טלית ותפיליו. The three מצות dependent on this time each utilize recognition in their own right, as such:

- Dawning Tefilin at nighttime violates a Rabbinic prohibition;<span data-footnote>The 1<sup>st</sup> Parasha discussing תפילין features a commandment to remember יציאת מצרים, ending off with the verse of "וְשָׁמַרְתָּ֛ אֶת־הַחֻקָּ֥ה הַזֹּ֖את לְמוֹעֲדָ֑הּ מִיָּמִ֖ים יָמִֽימָה׃" (Bo, 7<sup>th</sup> Aliya). According to the בריתא's reading (quoted in מנחות בבלי לו׃, used by R' Yose HaGlili) that connects this verse to the verse prior (of "וְהָיָה֩ לְךָ֨ לְא֜וֹת עַל־יָדְךָ֗ וּלְזִכָּרוֹן֙ בֵּ֣ין עֵינֶ֔יךָ", which discusses תפילין), the Biblical חוק refers to the limitation on when one can wear Tefilin, deduced from the word "מִיָּמִ֖ים" (whether it transgresses a positive commandment [רבי אלעזר, quoted Bavli ibid & ברכות ירושלמי פרק ב הלכה ג] or a negative commandment [רבי יוחנן, quoted Bavli ibid]; both dependent on the interpretation of the word ושמרת). This Biblical prohibition was quoted in Halachic Midrashim (מכילתא דרבי ישמעאל, פרשת בא, סוף פרשת יז), accepted by the Geonim (Rav Moshe Gaon, found in הלכות פסוקות מן הגאונים סימן סו) and codified (as a negative commandment) by HaRambam (MT, Laws of Tefilin, 4:11), by fixing the text of "וְחָשַׁךְ וְהִנִּיחַ תְּפִילִּין" to instead read "וחשך ולא סליק תפילי" (see Kesef Mishne).<br>However, Maran's other foremost authority (Rosh, Laws of Tefilin 16-17; relying on the reading of Tosafot ibid & בעל התרומה סימן ריג) read the verse as referring to the Korban Pesaḥ (just as רבי עקיבא, Bavli ibid), leaving no room for a Biblical prohibition from wearing Tefilin at nighttime. Instead, our Sages forbade it through a decree, out of concern that one would sleep with them on. The conclusive law was agreed upon by other Geonim (רב יהודאי גאון, הלכות פסוקות מן הגאונים סימן סב) and codified for our practice by Maran (S"A O"Ḥ 30:2).</span> the prohibition ends, though, after the time that "וְרָאוּ֙ כׇּל־עַמֵּ֣י הָאָ֔רֶץ כִּ֛י שֵׁ֥ם [השם] נִקְרָ֣א עָלֶ֑יךָ" could happen<span data-footnote>Rabbenu Yonah's utilization of the verse (Deuteronomy 28:10), found on the Rif's version of ברכות בבלי in new Oz Vahadar pg 11/old pages 4b</span>
- The obligation of ציצית comes from a status of "וראיתם אותו",<span data-footnote>פרשת שלך, עליית מפטיר</span> making the commandment focused around the day. Thereby, according to all opinions, one does not fulfill the mitzvah if they wear a night-time garment with four tied corners during the night. On the other hand, one wearing a day-time garment with four tied corners during the day fulfills the commandment of ציצית according to all opinions.<span data-footnote>Maran (S"A O"Ḥ 18:1) did not conclude like either opinion, leaving both readings valid</span> The gauge of what's considered day is from מישיכיר onwards.

The works of earlier authorities did not codify any clock time, possibly due to the acknowledgement that
