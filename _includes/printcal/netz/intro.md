When the גמרה attributed those benefits to the connection of גאולה (the last of ברכות שמע) and תפילה (the עמידה), the Maharsha/Tosafot point out its redundancy when taken at face value; after all, <i>everyone</i> conjoins Geula and Tefila. To resolve the apparent redundancy, they assert that the praise/blessing only works by this early time. This expectation was then explicitly codified (רמב"ם הלכות תפילה וברכת כהנים, ג:א).</span> by sunrise. Kabbalistically, this routine is essential to the upholding of the world itself, as it defends (either through testimony<span data-footnote>בתנא דבי אליהו זוטא פרק כב</span> or the light of kindness revealed by Hashem's mercy<span data-footnote>בא"ח ריש פר' פנחס</span>) against the prosecuting angels/forces of evil aiming to destroy the Jewish people.

Sepharadic communities featured customs that surrounded this time, such as בקשות (on שבת) or Seliḥot<span data-footnote>משנה תורה הלכות תשובה ג:ד, שו"ע או"ח תקפא:א</span> requests during the weekdays in the month of Elul and the Ten Days of Repentence.<span data-footnote>These rituals took place during the last four hours of the night, which contained Kabbalistic relevance by means of praying בשעת עת רצון.<br>ע"ע בי"י (מהדורה תשע"ו) אמוד מה</span> Other practices (such as staying all night to learn, whether for one or two<span data-footnote>בא"ח במדבר ז, כף החיים תצד:ו</span> (when applicable) nights of <span class="hebMidWord">חג השבועות</span><span data-footnote>חז"ע יו"ט שט</span> or the night of <span class="hebMidWord">הושענא רבה</span><span data-footnote>חז"ע סוכות עמוד תלח</span>) are scattered all throughout the Jewish calendar. As time went along, the application of תפילת שחרית בהנץ החמה also became subject to customs, with Maran Ovadia only<span data-footnote>ארחות מרן ז:ד</span> praying at this time for the surrounding customs & laws (an example of the latter is <span class="hebMidWord">תקופת החמה</span><span data-footnote>This is a custom name we gave to the Tekufa which would contain ברכת החמה; one would avoid water during that one hour period (as explained later), wait until the next morning to wake up and pray by הנץ החמה to say this ברכה as soon as possible.

The other days of the year, though, aren't subject to these customs. Since these מצות's end-time extends into the day, it is a conflict of priorities between this element of prayer against the obligation of <span class="hebMidWord">תלמוד תורה</span><span data-footnote>י"י או"ח א (מהדורה תשפ"א) סימן פט</span> and the importance of <span class="hebMidWord">תיקון חצות</span>.<span data-footnote>י"י או"ח א (מהדורה תשפ"א) אמוד צ, אור לציון חלק א תשובה יב<br>For a disputed interpretation, read the responsa from "Divre Shalom" (end of 5<sup>th</sup> volume, section of "הערות והנהגות", seif 1).

Although prayer by sunrise is an expectation, it is not an obligation and one should not compromise on their learning to follow said expectation, as explained in the Yalkut Yosef (2021 Edition, Siman 89).

<!-- all the concerns when we have calendars and clocks that tell us the exact times. Additionally, even a שליח צבור who does not measure to the clock can aim for a window of time of 2 minutes surrounding sunrise (even before), and it will still count as sunrise (as we'll explain later). The only risk is one praying without a time of reference, since one should not go outside to try finding There is even less of a concern by מנחה (which is the prayer they were referring to when they voiced their disapproval, according to Rashi), since Maran Ovadia held that the time for מנחה ends by the Geonic Nightf a ספק ספיקא to permit praying during the Geonic night-twilight (Maybe the law goes like the other authorities that permit מנחה until Nightfall, and maybe it's still day - either based on the nature of twilight or the law potentially following RT for the length of the day), prior to the Geonic Nightfall.
