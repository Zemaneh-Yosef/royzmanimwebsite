###### Night (Three Stars)

The Jewish Calendar's day fully begins<span data-footnote>This beginning includes all of its obligations, such as reading the night's קריאת שמע (S.A. 235 1), reading the מגילה on Purim, checking for חמץ on ערב פסח amongst others</span> at Nightfall and ends at sunset. Thus, the period of twilight between the two is a combination of the stringencies<span data-footnote>It is not all stringent, though, as some obligations one couldn't fulfill throughout the day could be done during this time period, such as תפילת מנחה (Y"Y 235:5), wearing תפילין or shaking the דלת מינים</span> from both days, and the nature of this twilight introduces a doubt between whether it's day or night (with it possibly being even both). This period of doubt (legally called בן השמשות) happens until Nightfall, which happens when three stars are visible.<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">שבת בבלי לה:</span></span>

The calculated letter-of-the-law time of twilight is as short as 13½ [adjusted-]seasonal minutes<span data-footnote>הליכות עולם (ח"א עמוד רנ), חזון עובדיה (יו"ט עמוד רלב ודש; ארבע תעניות עמוד טו; חנוכה עמוד עג)</span> after sunset.<span data-footnote>Some may wonder: How is it possible for three stars to be visible in such a short time after sunset? Several authorities explain that the sign of stars is indeed not so easily discernable to the average person (even with good vision and visibility of the stars) because they are miniscule points within a broad picture, requiring even a faint star to be fixated on (while knowing where it would even first appear) prior to being able to discern it (ספר "לילה ויום של תורה" דף קע"ה והזמנים בהלכה ב' דפים תפ"ח-תצ"ג) in contrast to the vastly large sky background (יביע אומר ז' מ"א:ז' בשם גרא"ז, פני יהושע, גר"א). Light pollution is also a factor, which means that those living in cities are simply unable to see three stars immediately as they emerge.</span> Nevertheless, there are cases which either recommend or demand different levels of stringency,<span data-footnote>These <i>stringencies</i> are not meant as <i>leniencies</i>, whether its through passive actions (such as missing the timeframe of הדלקת נרות חנוכה or additional fasting throughout שבת on the fast of עשרה בטבת that fell on ערב שבת) or active actions (such as starting to pray תפילת מנחה or counting ספירת העומר on the previous day)</span> each to be handled independently:

- An "extended בין השמשות"<span data-footnote>רמב"ם הלכות תרומות ז:ב</span> is used for letter-of-the-law Biblical rulings,<span data-footnote>Examples include determining the day of a ברית מילה if a baby was born on Friday Night, and the tevilah time for a Nidah. However, this is non-applicable for starting the Passover Seder; <i>any</i> delay is a leniency in the commandment of והגדת לבנך.</span> as well as the <i>recommended</i> time to end a Rabbinic fast.<span data-footnote>חז"ע ארבע צומות דף יב.</span> In Israel, simply waiting 20 fixed minutes will give you this time; outside Eretz Yisrael, it's instead a calculated 20 seasonal minutes.

- By redefining the word "sunset", _Rabbenu Tam_<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">פסחים בבלי צד.</span></span> created an offset of 58.5 minutes for the start of בין השמשות and Nightfall, thus letting Nightfall happen **only after 72 [adjusted-]seasonal minutes** after the sun has already set. We _recommend_<span data-footnote>This definition of בין השמשות was practiced by the majority of early authorities, the Shulḥan Arukh (<span class="hebSrc">או"ח סימן רס"א:ב.</span>) & the pious of Sepharadim (<span class="hebSrc">אור לציון ד' פרק כ' הערה ב'</span>)<br>Nevertheless, our practice adheres to the Geonic legal definition; although RT's reading of the Gemara focused on the differences between the two "sunsets", it is possible to focus on the different "Nightfall"'s (גר"א על שו"ע או"ח סימן רס"א). Alternatively, perhaps there were different periods of thought for Rabbi Yehuda, leaving the position in Shabbat 34b as the conclusion of the legal debate (מהרם עלשקר צו, בשם תשובת הגאונים).</span> the resulting time of Nightfall for matters of Biblical stringency, such as repeating קריאת שמע של ערבית if one had only said after the regular Nightfall<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">ילקוט יוסף רל"ה:ב'</span>. If it was before the Geonic nightfall, it is not a recommendation and one would need to repeat it regardless</span> or to perform _melakha_ after שבת/יום כפור.<br>
Although various lenient reinterpretations have been suggested, only two of them are quoted in our authorities.<span data-footnote>By following deviations, one is not getting the legal definition of what Rabbenu Tam himself wrote. Since the definitions of RT and the Geonim are the only legal definitions, these other stringencies on the Geonic opinion are intellectually dishonest (especially when they're sourced by "their heart's desires" - see יחוה דעת חלק ז סימן נו) and a misrepresentation of the debate between the two opinions (which should have a distinction of almost an hour between them - see ילקוט יוסף מהדורה חדשה סימן רצג עמוד תשטו)<br>Thus, Maran zt"l himself was not a fan for <i>any</i> leniency for RT; nevertheless, our calendar is based on the practiced laws of Maran zt"l as presented by R' Yitzḥak Yosef & R' David Yosef</span> Our print-out calendar implements the leniency to limit this time entry to 72 fixed minutes outside Eretz Yisrael when the seasonal equivalent surpasses it.<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">ילקוט יוסף (מהדורה חדשה) סימן רצ"ג עמוד תשכד; הלכה ברורה, הקדמת לסימן רס"א הלכה י"ט; יודעי בינה ז':ו'</span><br>Those wanting to undo this leniency can measure the time from Dawn until sunrise and wait that amount of time after sunset to get the resulting 72 adjusted-seasonal minutes equivalent.</span> The other (unimplemented)<span data-footnote>To implement this one, measure the time from Misheyakir to sunrise, then wait that amount of time after sunset to get a time with only 1½ minutes extra</span> leniency involves using RT's בן השמשות in its leniency.<span data-footnote>ילקוט יוסף (מהדורה תשנ"ב) סימן רצ"ג הלכה ה</span>

Nightfall is not the only dependency for צאת שבת ויום טוב; in addition to the mandated extended-<span class="hebMidWord">בין השמשות</span>,<span data-footnote>To avoid any potential acts of desecration, we have chosen to hide the regular nightfall time for any Shabbat/Yom Tov. Those looking to use it for legitimate purposes (such as the latest time one could start שעודת שלישית בדיעבד) should look to applying this time *from the prior/following day* (whichever is more stringent).</span> there is a requirement to add a time of <span class="hebMidWord">תוספת שבת</span>.<span data-footnote><span class="hebSrc">שו"ע או"ח רצ"ג:א'</span></span> Although there is a basis to be more lenient than our listed times,<span data-footnote>ע"ע בילקוט טהרה מכתב עז - The resulting time applied astronomically in Eretz Yisrael would result in an earlier time than we list</span> our chosen default for outside Eretz Yisrael uses an algorithm that matches the Ohr Hachaim calendar when applied in Israel, extends ביו השמשות to encompass all possible delays to the Geonic Nightfall<span data-footnote>However, being stringent as such is only happenstance and not our intentions, since we hold they do not have a source in the Talmud/early authorities; see עין יצחק חלק ג עמוד תיא for a discussion regarding the מג'רב - the longest delay to the Geonic Nightfall (held by the BI"Ḥ [שנה ראשונה, ויקהל ד'] & Ohr Letzion [חלק א יו"ד סימן י]).</span> & even accommodates the astronomical reality of how seasonal twilight works.<span data-footnote>Although we generally use [adjusted-]seasonal minutes even in the winter (hence making the time of Nightfall shorter in the winter than in the spring/fall), this is not accurate to the way astronomy works - _those_ minutes extend in the winter compared to their spring/fall counterpart. Since the Talmud used the star's visibility as an indicator for Nightfall (something that's astronomical) and the S"A was concerned for an astronomical star-visibility as a doubt prior to taking out Shabbat (<span class="hebMidWord">או"ח רצ"ג:ב'</span>), it is worthy to be stringent by ending Shabbat/Yom Tov through this description.<br>Thus, our listed "degree" is measured at 7.165º, the equivalent of the sun's position below the horizon 30 minutes after sunset in the quickest Nightfall of the year (spring/fall) in Israel.</span> Within Eretz Yisrael, we've instead matched the Ohr Hachaim calendar, which places it at 30 fixed minutes every שבת/יום טוב of the year<span data-footnote>יחוה דעת חלק ז סימן נו, ילקוט יוסף מהדורה חדשה סימן רצג עמוד תשטו. גם זבחי צדק חלק ב יו"ד סימן יז עמוד סו וחלק ג סימן קד עמוד קצח.<br>This still fits within our astronomical concerns - it's an all encompassing number that the legal Geonic extended-Nightfall time of 20 seasonal minutes will never go over 30.</span>
