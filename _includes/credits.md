These libraries are not ideal, and we plan to replace them (either natively or through a rewrite) when possible. Nevertheless, here's our appreciation for them at the current moment

- **[flexcal](https://github.com/dwachss/flexcal):** A jQuery(-UI) plugin to have a Hebrew-Date picker. To be replaced with a custom implementation built around KosherZmanim
- **[Material Design Web](https://m3.material.io/develop/web):** Replace MDBootstrap's list selector, due to MDBootstrap's being paid.
- **[pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/):** Embedded PDF viewer, because native ones either force the person to download the PDF on page-load or have issues scrolling
- **[linkedom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linkedom):** Used to make DOM code for Web Workers, used for the print-out calendar generator
- **[paged.js](https://pagedjs.org/):** Used as a polyfill for the W3C Print Specifications. Other editors conflict with our static site mentality
