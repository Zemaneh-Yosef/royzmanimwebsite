### Transliteration guide

- ב without a Dagesh is v (sorry Syrians)
- ג without a Dagesh is gh
- ד without a Dagesh is dh
- ו is v (unfortunately)
- ח is ḥ
- ט and ת Degusha is T (we know it loses precision)
- כ without a dagesh is kh
- ע should be represented with an apostrophe (unless in the beginning of a word).
- פ without a dagesh is interchangeably f/ph. Depends on the context
- צ for right now is tz (unfortunately)
- ק is Q.
- ת without a dagesh is th

Each individual case could be an exception (like "Kaballah", "Hashachar", or nouns which already have their own transliteration like "ChaiTables").

### Source quoting guide

There are two ways to describe the things relevant to what we do:
1. Giving people present-day context which briefly explained what is displayed as default options on the apps/websites.
2. Giving learners background development that would show how the concept developed to the P'sak Halakha of today.

We employ both strategies by giving off an introductionary paragraph briefly telling them the definition of what they see and then go through calculation methods after an `<hr>` tag. Additionally, if there is a section on alternative calculations (such as how Dawn could be 90 minutes minutes instead of the typical 72 minutes), it could be added as a third section without alluding to it in previous paragraphs, since we would only display it on the pop-up description. Last section would be any fun fact we could find.

The first strategy is easy, and should be reasonable. Unfortunately, the second one isn't since many start their learning from the Shulḥan Arukh as if it has an inheret status of הוראה of its own and not just a compilation of other פוסקים that got their understanding from the days of הוראה. Thereby, it's important to document how to learn (and by extension, what to write for here):
1. We're discussing a Sugya, which means it should always start from the Mishnayoth & Talmud (whether Bavli, Yerushalmi or both).
  - Ideally, any verse they quote should also be quoted here.
  - If the idea is Kabbalistic, there isn't a guarantee for its inclusion in the Talmud. Each case should be analyzed independently, but a majority of the time, it is bouncing off attempted P'sak (such as Arizal holding R"T matching what Maran held in 261:2 or Tekufot being based on RH"G).
    - A quoted עץ חיים should use the אהבת שלום Girsa.
2. Use HaRambam to explain the Gemarot, and interpret any possible argument on P'sak by other Amudeh Hora'ah's as deviations (even if they are what we hold by). Quotations from HaRambam should be done using the *Q'afiḥ* girsa.
3. As Maran Ovadia outlined in the Halikhot Olam introduction (vol. I), only after these Amudeh Hora'ah's would he then rely on other Rishonim, such as the Ramban (not prevalent except for Tzet & Pelag), Rashba, Ran, Mordechi & Sefer Mitzvot Gedholoth.
3. Obviously quote the Shulḥan Arukh/Bet Yosef and anyone from the ROY lineage. Other Acharonim should be limited to the Ben Ish Ḥai, Kaf Haḥaim & Mishnah Berurah (people are Ashkinormative + commentaries like the עמודי הוראה help).

- These are all textual sources, which help for being able to learn on Shabbat. However, for our generation that is very video-inclined, you could help with an idea by *minimally* quoting audio/video sources, provided they are on TorahAnytime. (YouTube _can_ be used, but switch `youtube.com` or `youtu.be` to `vid.puffyan.us` - an Invidious instance hosted in the United States)
- Although the titles of the books could be quoted in English (to maintain flow and not always switch between Hebrew & English), please refer to individual sections in parenthesis, written in Hebrew
